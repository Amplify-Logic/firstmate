# Onboarding on Windows: WSL 2 to a working first mate

Firstmate runs on Linux and macOS, so on a Windows PC it runs inside WSL 2, Windows' built-in Linux.
Inside WSL 2 your PC behaves like a Linux machine, and every tool a first mate needs has a Linux build.
Plain Windows (PowerShell or Git Bash) is not supported.

This guide covers the Windows-only part, about 45 minutes, mostly waiting for installs.
Then you finish with the shared steps of [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md), exactly as a Mac user does.

**You need:** Windows 11 (22H2 or newer is best) or Windows 10 version 2004 or newer, 16 GB of RAM or more, and admin rights once.
If your PC is work-managed, has less memory, or you cannot get admin rights, use [a small Linux server](ONBOARDING-linux-server.md) instead.

## 1. Two accounts

Do [step 1 of ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md#1-two-accounts-browser-before-the-terminal): a GitHub account and a Claude subscription.

---

## 2. Turn on WSL 2

Right-click the Start button, choose **Terminal (Admin)** (or **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**), and run:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

Restart the PC when it asks.
After the restart an Ubuntu window opens and asks for a new UNIX username and password.
Pick a short lowercase name and a password you will remember: Linux asks for it when it installs software.

Check, in PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl -l -v
```

You should see `Ubuntu-24.04` with `VERSION` `2`.
If it says `1`, run `wsl --set-version Ubuntu-24.04 2`.

If the install says virtualization is off, turn on "Virtualization Technology" (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) in your PC's BIOS or UEFI settings, then run the command again.

## 3. Give WSL the right network and memory

Still in PowerShell, open the WSL settings file:

```powershell
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"
```

Let Notepad create it, paste this, and save:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
memory=8GB
```

- `networkingMode=mirrored` lets review boards and the app's web preview open in your normal Windows browser through `localhost`.
  It needs Windows 11 22H2 or newer; on Windows 10, leave that line out, and `localhost` still works through WSL's default forwarding.
- `memory=8GB` suits a 16 GB PC: a first mate, a few workers, a dev server and Chrome want about 8 GB.
  With 32 GB or more you can leave it out.

Apply it:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

---

## 4. Use Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal is built in on Windows 11 and in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10.
Open it, go to **Settings**, then **Startup**, and set **Default profile** to **Ubuntu-24.04**.
Every new tab now opens in Ubuntu, in your Linux home.

---

## 5. The one rule: everything lives in `~`

Keep Firstmate and every project in your Linux home, `~` (for example `/home/ana`).
**Never** under `/mnt/c/...`: that is your Windows C: drive seen through a slow bridge, where git is slow, file watching breaks, and file permissions do not stick.

```sh
cd ~
pwd
```

You should see `/home/<your-name>`.
To look at your Linux files from Windows, run `explorer.exe .` in Ubuntu.
To edit them, install VS Code on Windows with its WSL extension and run `code .` in Ubuntu.

---

## 6. Run the setup script

In an Ubuntu tab, from your home:

```sh
cd ~
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amplify-Logic/firstmate/main/bin/fm-linux-setup.sh | bash
```

It asks for your Ubuntu password once, then installs the build tools, Homebrew, git, node, gh, tmux, Claude Code and Chrome, and clones Firstmate into `~/starship`.
About 15 minutes.

You should see a list of `ok` lines and `Setup finished.`
First close the tab and open a new Ubuntu tab, so the new tools are on your PATH; in the old tab, `gh` and `claude` are not found.
Then, in the new tab, do the two sign-ins it prints:

```sh
gh auth login
claude
```

For `gh`, choose **GitHub.com**, then **HTTPS**, then **Login with a web browser**; the browser opens on Windows.
For `claude`, sign in, then type `/exit`.

---

## 7. Use tmux as your view

Herdr is the Mac guide's richer view; on Windows, use tmux, the longest-tested option.
Tell Firstmate before you launch:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/starship/config
echo tmux > ~/starship/config/backend
```

Start the first mate inside a tmux session, so every worker appears as a window you can watch:

```sh
tmux new -s firstmate
```

`Ctrl-b` then `w` lists the windows; `Ctrl-b` then `d` detaches, and `tmux attach -t firstmate` brings it back.

---

## 8. Finish with the shared steps

Continue with [ONBOARDING.md step 3, the preflight checkpoint](ONBOARDING.md#3-preflight-checkpoint-before-you-start-the-agent), inside your tmux session in Ubuntu, and go on through the slug round-trip in step 7.
Skip step 2 of that guide: the setup script did it.
The checkpoint shows ⚠️ for Herdr; that is expected, because you chose tmux.

When the first mate's startup checks run, it also tells you if anything sits under `/mnt/` or if `localhost` cannot reach Windows.

---

## Working on an app from Windows

- **Web preview:** a dev server started in Ubuntu (for example `pnpm web`) opens in your Windows browser at the `localhost` address it prints.
- **Phone preview with Expo Go:** your phone cannot reach WSL's network directly.
  Start Expo with `npx expo start --tunnel` and scan the QR code.
- **iOS simulator:** needs a Mac.
  Use the web build, an Android emulator, or a cloud build instead.

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Do this |
|---|---|
| `fm-linux-setup.sh: ... is on the Windows drive` | Run `cd ~` and start the setup again. |
| `this is WSL 1` | In PowerShell: `wsl --set-version Ubuntu-24.04 2`, then run the setup again. |
| A board link or `localhost` page does not open in Windows | Check `.wslconfig` from step 3, run `wsl --shutdown`, open a new Ubuntu tab, and start again. |
| `command not found: brew`, `claude`, or `gh` after setup | Open a new Ubuntu tab; the old one has the old PATH. |
| Everything is slow | Check `pwd`: your project must be under `/home/...`, never `/mnt/c/...`. |

For anything else, use the troubleshooting table in [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md#10-troubleshooting).
