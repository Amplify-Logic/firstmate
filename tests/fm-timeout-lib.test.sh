# Behavior tests for bin/fm-timeout-lib.sh, the bounded read-only probe helper.
#
# The property under test is that a bounded probe still returns the command's
# output when a TERMINAL is attached to the caller.
# Every bound in the helper runs the command in its own process group so a
# timeout can kill the group, which also moves it out of the terminal's
# foreground process group.
# A probed CLI that touches the terminal then takes SIGTTOU and stops until the
# bound kills it, so the caller reads an empty answer from a healthy tool.
# That failure is invisible without a terminal, which is why it reached a
# release: it refused `firstmate claude` at its account seat check while every
# non-interactive caller and test saw the same probe pass.
