#   - a home that never opted in stays silent;
#   - nothing is spoken that the register owner refused;
#   - nothing is spoken that the register owner never shaped;
#   - the caller's turn is never held open by audio or by a hung shaper.
# The register itself is owned by the glasses project and tested there. These
# tests drive a fake owner that implements its documented exit contract, so the
