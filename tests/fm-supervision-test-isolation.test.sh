# tests/fm-supervision-test-isolation.test.sh - supervision tests are hermetic.
#
# A supervision test spawns REAL watchers, arms, and daemons. Every one of those
# entry points prefers an inherited FM_HOME over its script-relative root, so a
# single leaked operational-home variable from the invoking environment (a live
# firstmate lane exporting FM_HOME is the observed case) silently rebinds a
# fixture watcher onto the primary home's state: it steals the real watch lock,
# touches the real liveness beacon, and a fixture --restart TERMs the real fleet
# watcher. This suite pins the guarantees that make that impossible again:
#   1. tests/lib.sh drops every inherited operational-home variable at source.
#   2. A real watcher started with NO overrides resolves only the hermetic
#      fixture home and never writes into a planted foreign home.
#   3. A real `fm-watch-arm.sh --restart` started against the suite's own empty
#      home cannot see, stop, or rewrite anything in a planted foreign home.
#   4. Suite teardown reaps ONLY path-scoped children - processes whose command
#      path lies inside this worktree or a registered fixture temp dir - so no
#      supervision process outlives its fixture and no same-named process
#      outside that scope (a real home's live supervision) is ever signalled.
