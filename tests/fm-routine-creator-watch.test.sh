#
# Every case runs the script from a fixture firstmate clone whose origin is a
# local bare repository, publishes to a separate local bare reports repository,
# and reads fixture "watched" repositories over file:// URLs, so no case touches
# GitHub or a real routine. The cases pin the safety contract as well as the
# digest: the only ref the script ever writes is main of the reports
# repository, the firstmate clone and its origin are never changed, third-party
# text never reaches stdout, a paused reports repository receives nothing, and a
# run whose every read failed publishes nothing either.
