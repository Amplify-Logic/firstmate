# Behavior tests for the opt-in twice-daily dropped-threads digest and its schedule.
#
# Contracts under test:
#   - A home with no `enabled = true` line is completely inert.
#   - The digest lists live and aged captain holds with their due dates, open
#     questions from work under way, other held items whose date has arrived,
#     and in-flight tasks whose newest stamped status event is older than
#     stale_hours, most pressing first, in one spoken sentence plus a short list
#     with no links in it.
#   - Each slot publishes once, at or after its local time; a morning missed
#     while asleep is caught up later that day unless the evening time has also
#     passed; nothing is published before the morning time.
#   - When nothing is waiting the slot's record says so and nothing is spoken.
#   - It only reports: the backlog, status logs and wake queue are untouched and
#     no captain inbox note is written.
#   - A failed collection writes nothing, so the next run retries the slot.
#   - Local configuration is validated and unknown keys are refused.
#   - The schedule renders, installs and removes against a temporary home and a
#     fake launchd transport, and refuses a home that never opted in.
