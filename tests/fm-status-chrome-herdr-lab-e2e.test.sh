# tests/fm-status-chrome-herdr-lab-e2e.test.sh - real-herdr evidence for the
# status companion's chrome mode (docs/status-bar.md "Herdr chrome mode").
#
# Chrome mode reclaims the companion pane's empty rows by publishing the
# canonical row onto the PRIMARY pane's own border title and then hiding the
# companion with `pane zoom --on`. Three Herdr surfaces carry that: the border
# title store, `pane zoom --on/--off`, and `pane layout`. `pane zoom` and
# `pane layout` are first uses of those verbs in this repo, and Herdr draws
# borders in its TUI CLIENT rather than its server, so `pane read` cannot see
# any of it. This test therefore measures the real binary through the isolated
# lab and its rendered screen, rather than assuming the shape.
#
# What it establishes:
#
# - `pane zoom --on` hides the companion and reclaims its rows, while the
#   primary's border title still renders.
# - `pane layout` reports the tab's pane count and its `zoomed` flag correctly
#   while zoomed, and again after a third pane appears.
# - `pane zoom --off` releases the zoom, and is idempotent when Herdr has
#   already released it itself.
# - A deliberate unzoom is PRESERVED: the live renderer keeps publishing the
#   border row and never re-applies the zoom.
#
# Safety: every Herdr call goes through bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh, which owns the
# isolation contract - a generated named non-default `fm-lab-` session, the
# refuse-default hard guard before each destructive call, and the fleet-state
# tripwire that teardown verifies byte-identical afterward. The default session
# is never touched.
