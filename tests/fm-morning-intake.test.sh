# Behavior tests for the opt-in morning intake gate and its schedule.
#
# Contracts under test:
#   - A home with no `enabled = true` line is completely inert, so cloning the
#     repo or seeding another home never enrolls a device.
#   - The intake arms once per configured local day, at or after the threshold;
#     repeat scheduled polls neither re-arm nor enqueue a second wake.
#   - A morning missed while asleep or offline is caught up by the first run
#     after the threshold, on the real local date, with no simulated sleep.
#   - The wake actually drives an intake to a completed, acknowledged report:
#     arm -> registered watcher check -> claim -> report -> complete -> pending
#     -> acknowledge, through the same commands a live orchestrator runs.
#   - A failed or partial intake cannot advance the completion watermark, and a
#     corrected source message after a same-day failure is still ingested.
#   - Retries are bounded and the exhausted state stays visible, including for a
#     failure recorded before any claim, and only `reset` gives the budget back.
#   - Writes to the durable record are serialized, so a watcher sweep cannot
#     overwrite a claim that a live orchestrator is holding.
#   - Arming the watcher check is all-or-nothing: a registration failure leaves
#     no shim behind for the watcher to reject on every sweep.
#   - Losing that shim is detectable: while an intake is armed or owed, the
#     read-only session-start surface reports an absent or unregistered live
#     check and names `arm-check`, and re-arming is idempotent and rebinds a
#     shim whose bytes drifted.
#   - `run --force` arms outside the configured window but never overrides the
#     bounded retry budget; only `reset` gives that budget back.
#   - A timezone that does not resolve is refused instead of silently becoming
#     UTC, and `rearm` on a new local day starts from a fresh budget.
#   - No existing fleet is overridden: no session lock is taken, no watcher is
#     started, and a foreign home's records are untouched.
#   - Local configuration stays private: unknown keys are refused rather than
#     parked, and status prints only declared knobs.
#   - Install and uninstall work against a temporary home and a fake launchd
#     transport, and refuse a home that never opted in.
