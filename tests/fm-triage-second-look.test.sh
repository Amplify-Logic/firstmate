# tests/fm-triage-second-look.test.sh - the opt-in second look over the status
# lines the deterministic wake classifier drops.
#
# Three surfaces, each with its own failure mode:
#   - status_span_dropped_lines (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh): the pure span read that
#     decides WHICH lines are eligible at all, including the three declarations
#     that are silent by design and must stay silent;
#   - bin/fm-triage-second-look.sh: the opt-in gate, the escalate-only request,
#     the threshold rule and every fail-open path;
#   - the away-mode daemon's catch-all backstop (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh):
#     that a promotion actually reaches the escalation buffer with its reason,
#     and that an unarmed home adds nothing.
#
# The always-on watcher's heartbeat backstop is the other call site, and its
# cases live with the rest of that backstop's coverage in
# tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh, which already owns the scaffolding that drives a
# real fm-watch.sh subprocess.
#
# Only the network is stubbed. Every case drives the real classifier, the real
# request build and the real thresholds against the recorded 2026-09-17 probe
# response in tests/fixtures/triage-second-look/, so a threshold or question
# change that would have promoted or silenced a different line fails here.
# The live smoke against the real API is tests/fm-triage-second-look-live-e2e.test.sh.
