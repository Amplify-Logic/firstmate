# Opt-in end-to-end proof over the REAL launchd transport, which every other case

# the caller's own `gui/<uid>` launchd domain, so it must be an explicit, attended
# choice on a macOS login session rather than something CI or a parallel shard
# does implicitly.
#
# It cannot post a real desktop notification, and that is structural rather than
# configured. launchd runs a COPY of the sentinel inside the scratch home, and the
# sentinel resolves its alert owner as fm-supervise-daemon.sh NEXT TO ITSELF - so
# the copy's alert owner is a stub that only appends to a file. The real daemon,
# and therefore every real notifier, is not reachable from the launched process at
# all, whatever any config lookup does. Production plist generation deliberately
# has no notifier-override knob to abuse instead.
