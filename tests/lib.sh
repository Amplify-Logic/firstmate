# --- self-cleaning temp root ------------------------------------------------
#
# fm_test_tmproot <prefix> echoes a fresh temp dir and registers it for removal
# on EXIT/INT/TERM. A test file that needs extra teardown (e.g. killing a
# daemon) should define its own EXIT trap and call fm_test_cleanup from inside
# it so registered dirs are still removed.
#
# The call site is almost always `TMP_ROOT=$(fm_test_tmproot prefix)`, which
# forks a subshell to capture stdout. Anything that function does to the
# current shell's state - an array append, a trap - dies with that subshell
# and never reaches the real caller, so registration cannot go through
# in-process state. `$$` is the one thing bash keeps stable across that
# boundary (it always resolves to the invoking shell's PID, not the
# subshell's - see `man bash` on `$$`), so fm_test_tmproot records the
# directory in a `$$`-keyed registry file instead, and the trap that reaps
# that file is armed once, here, at source time - which always runs in the
# real caller, never a subshell.

# same reason the temp roots do - a fixture home is almost always built inside a
# command substitution (`home=$(make_home x)`), and an array append there never
# reaches the caller, so a suite that tracked its homes in a shell array was
# silently tracking nothing and left every runner it started behind.

# private one). It never matches on a script or process name, which would reach

#
# fm_live_gate <policy> <vars> [tool ...]
#
# The single gate every live-harness guard opens with, so "can this host run
# this guard for real, and should it?" is decided in one place instead of in
# two dozen hand-rolled env checks. It returns 0 when the guard should run, and
# otherwise ends the script with one runner-readable line:
#
#   skip: live: <tool> absent                 this host cannot run the guard
#   skip: live: disabled by <VAR>=0           an explicit local opt-out
#   skip: live: opt-in; set <VAR>=1 to run    a guard that spends model tokens
#
# <policy> is default-on for a guard that spends no model tokens, so it runs
# wherever its tools are installed - notably on the machine the product and its
# validation actually run on - and opt-in for a guard that submits prompts,
# which stays deliberate. <vars> is the guard's own control variable, or a
# comma-separated list when a guard has more than one entry point.
#
# Setting any of those variables to 1 (or FM_LIVE=1, for every guard at once)
# both turns the guard on and makes an absent tool a hard failure rather than a
# skip, which is how "run it after a harness upgrade" keeps proving the guard
# actually ran. Setting one to 0 (or FM_LIVE=0) turns it off; a guard's own
# variable wins over FM_LIVE.
#
# Sourcing this library also exports FM_GATE_REFUSE_BYPASS=1, which is what
# lets a live guard drive the real fm-spawn/fm-send/fm-teardown from inside a
# no-mistakes gate worktree instead of being refused by
