# Real Claude Code guard for the desk floater's send past a draft.
# bin/fm-desk-voice.sh sets the captain's unsent draft aside with Claude's
# Ctrl+S stash, reads `› stashed` in Claude's footer, and relies on Claude
# putting the draft back when the message is submitted. All three are Claude's
# own rendering and keys, so this drives a real Claude in a private tmux
# server: the floater message must be submitted alone and the draft must be
# back in the chat box, never submitted.
# Run explicitly with FM_DESK_VOICE_CLAUDE_DRAFT_LIVE=1; it submits one short
