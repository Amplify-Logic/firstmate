# Regression test for the fm-spawn.sh treehouse-get worktree-detection settle
# loop (bin/fm-spawn.sh, the bounded poll loop after `treehouse get`).
#
# On some tmux/WSL setups a brand-new window's pane_current_path transiently
# reports a stale, unrelated-but-real path on the very first poll, before the
# pane actually settles into the worktree treehouse get moved it to. That stale
# path still passes the loop's "differs from the project" check and
# validate_spawn_worktree's "is a real, distinct worktree" check (it IS a real
# git checkout, just the wrong one), so a naive single-read loop silently
# records the wrong worktree= in state/<id>.meta. This test simulates pane
# path sequences with a fake tmux and asserts:
#   1. Two consecutive identical non-project reads are required to accept WT.
#   2. A single matching read followed by a different path is NOT accepted.
#   3. A pane that never settles fails cleanly at a short overridden bound
#      (never hangs toward the production 60s default).
