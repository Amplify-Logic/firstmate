# Regression tests for fm-spawn.sh's agent-up verification (bin/fm-spawn.sh,
# spawn_wait_agent_up / spawn_refuse_agent_never_started).
#
# The bug these pin: until an agent actually owns the pane, everything typed
# there is SHELL input. When the launch never started the agent, nothing ever
# read the brief, yet fm-spawn still reported "spawned", so the pane looked
# alive and a later steer "succeeded" into that same shell. kimi and rovo make
# it worse, because their brief pointer is TYPED into the pane after the launch
# rather than named on it.
#
# Asserted here, with a fake tmux whose window inventory and pane_current_command
# drive the shared liveness owner (fm_backend_tmux_agent_state):
#   1. kimi's post-launch brief is typed only AFTER the agent is proven up.
#   2. A pane still proven to be a bare shell refuses loudly at the bound,
#      without typing the brief. Dispatch is transactional, so the refusal rolls
#      this task's provisional record back and says so, names what does survive
#      (the endpoint, the local copy, the brief), and hands back the exact
#      re-spawn rather than an in-pane relaunch that would leave a worker the
#      backlog does not own.
#   3. The happy path is unchanged: the launch line still names the brief file
#      and the spawn still reports success.
#   4. A harness/backend pair whose liveness cannot be read (pi's generic node
#      process on tmux) neither refuses nor stalls to the bound.
#   5. The wait is bounded, and its knobs are validated before anything is
#      typed into the pane.
#   6. A structurally gone endpoint refuses on the FIRST read rather than
#      waiting out a bound whose answer can never change.
#
# One case needs a different backend, because the state it pins is one tmux can
# never report:
#   7. A backend with NO liveness reader at all (fake Orca) cannot run the check.
#      That is an unsupported check, not a failed one, so kimi still spawns
#      there and warns instead of losing a capability that worked before.

# make_herdr_case <name> <harness> <launch-binary>: a fake Herdr CLI holding its
# workspace/tab/pane state in one JSON file. By default it drops the task's pane
# the moment the launch Enter is sent, which is exactly herdr's pane_not_found
# shape and the only way to reach the `missing` state - tmux has no equivalent.
#
# Two env switches turn the same fake into a HEALTHY herdr endpoint, which is
# what the brief-delivery cases below need:
#   FM_FAKE_HERDR_KEEP_PANE=1   the pane survives the launch Enter.
#   FM_FAKE_HERDR_AGENT=<status> `agent get` reports a registered agent at that
#                                status instead of agent_not_found.
# Every `pane send-text` payload is also written verbatim to its own numbered
# file under $HERDR_SENDTEXT_DIR, because what this suite has to assert about
# the launch is a property of the exact bytes typed into the pane - including
# whether they contain a newline - which the shared arg log cannot preserve.
# A structurally gone endpoint can never come back and host an agent, so
# polling it out to the bound only delays a failure the first read already
# proved. On tmux that state is an empty window inventory: the window fm-spawn
# created is no longer listed, which is exactly what a killed window looks like.
