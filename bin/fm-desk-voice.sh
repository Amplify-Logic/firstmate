# Desk-voice delivery: captain-input transcripts and screenshots from the Mac
# floater.

#   fm-desk-voice.sh pending
#   fm-desk-voice.sh drain [--print]
#   fm-desk-voice.sh --help
#
# WHY: the floater is mouth/ears only. Transcripts meant for Firstmate must not
# be pasted into random terminals, and the floater must not act as a second
# Firstmate. The only terminal this script ever types into is the primary
# session that holds this home's session lock. (The floater's separate
# dictation mode pastes into the text box the captain chose, and reaches this
# script only through send --front-app below, when that text box is the
# primary's own chat; see docs/desk-floater.md.)
#
# send is the floater's talk-to-firstmate path. It types the message (the
# transcript and any screenshots, composed as deliver composes them) into
# the primary's own chat pane and presses Enter, so the words arrive at once,
# even mid-turn, without that pane needing focus. The pane is resolved from
# state/.lock: the lock's pid must be a live harness, the pane named by that
# process's own environment (TMUX_PANE, or HERDR_ENV + HERDR_PANE_ID, with the
# precedence bin/fm-supervisor-target-lib.sh owns) must exist, and the pane's
# root process must be that pid or one of its ancestors. The pane's composer
# must also read empty or pending (bin/fm-backend.sh fm_backend_composer_state):
# an unknown screen can be a modal dialog, a picker, or a dead shell, where
# typed words become keypresses. Claude's dim suggested prompt is not typed
# text, so a box showing only that reads empty. A screen showing a selection
# dialog (a pointer on a numbered option, or an Enter to select / Esc to
# cancel footer) is refused too, whatever the composer reads. Delivery goes
# through the backend's submit primitive (bin/fm-backend.sh
# fm_backend_send_text_submit), so any backend that can report a pane's root
# pid below can be added. When a Claude primary's box holds the captain's
# unsent draft (pending), the message goes past it instead: see
# send_past_draft below, which never submits, clears, or retypes the draft.
# Another harness's draft is joined by the message and submitted with it. A
# message of screenshots alone is the exception: it is typed only into a
# composer that reads empty, and goes to the mailbox past any draft, because
# a stray screenshot must never interrupt the captain's typing. The
# text is sent as the captain's plain words: control characters, newlines, and
# Unicode line separators become spaces, so nothing can submit early or reach
# the pane as a key.
# Outcomes, one line on stdout, exit 0:
#   sent: <backend> <target>              typed and submit confirmed
#   sent-unconfirmed: <backend> <target> (<verdict>)
#                                         typed and Enter sent, submit not
#                                         proven; never re-sent to the mailbox
#   mailbox: <path>                       the pane could not be resolved, its
#                                         composer was not empty or pending
#                                         (not empty, for screenshots alone),
#                                         it showed a selection dialog, a
#                                         Claude draft could not be set aside,
#                                         or the backend reported send-failed,
#                                         its known-undelivered verdict; the
#                                         message went to the mailbox below
#   not-in-front                          with --front-app and --front-tty
#                                         only: the chat is not what the
#                                         captain is typing in; nothing sent
# A message therefore reaches the primary exactly one way.
#
# send --front-app <pid> --front-tty <tty> is the floater's dictation path: it
# sends only when the text box with the cursor is the primary's own chat, and
# otherwise prints "not-in-front" and delivers nothing, so the floater pastes
# the text where the cursor is instead. <pid> is the frontmost Mac app and
# <tty> the terminal device of its frontmost tab. The chat is in front when
# the proven primary pane is the multiplexer's focused pane (herdr: that
# pane's own focused flag; tmux: the active pane of its session's active
# window) and a client of that multiplexer runs on <tty> beneath <pid>. A
# herdr client is found by the kernel's socket facts (lsof): a process whose
# unix socket peers with a socket of the server that owns this pane's API
# socket, and whose standard input is <tty>. An unresolved primary counts as
# not in front. Once in front, every send check above still applies, so an
# unreadable chat or a selection dialog still goes to the mailbox.
#
# ring is the mid-turn doorbell other captain-input paths use: it types <line>
# into the same proven primary pane, with every send check above, and never
# falls back to the mailbox, because the caller has already queued its own
# durable wake. It types only into a composer that reads empty, so a draft the
# captain is writing is never submitted with it. One line on stdout, exit 0:
#   rung: <backend> <target>              typed and submit confirmed
#   rung-unconfirmed: <backend> <target> (<verdict>)
#   not-rung                              nothing typed; the queued wake stands
# Ring and send share a per-home pane-writer lock through inspection, typing,
# submission and recovery. On contention send uses its mailbox and ring leaves
# its queued wake alone. Ring leaves a Claude stash alone, and send presses
# Enter only once over one, as a stash is restored on submission. Before every
# ring Enter, including retries, the box must still show only the ring's
# literal payload.
#
# deliver is the mailbox path. Transcripts land under
#   $FM_HOME/state/desk-voice/inbox/<utc>-<id>.json
# and a single wake is appended so the primary can see and drain them.
# A wake alone reaches a busy primary only at its next turn end, minutes
# later, so deliver also rings the primary, as a captain inbox note does: a
# detached ring (every check above, empty composer only) of one labelled line
# asking it to drain now. A ring that cannot be typed yet is tried again after
# FM_DESK_VOICE_RING_DELAYS seconds (default "0 2 5 10 20 30 60 60 60", about
# four minutes in all; empty turns the ring off). The ring stops once it is
# typed, once the message has been drained, when no proven primary holds the
# session lock, or in away or quiet mode, whose own supervision owns wakes.
# The queued wake stays the durable delivery either way.
#
# deliver --image (repeatable, absolute path to an existing file) attaches
# screenshots: the message becomes the transcript, if any, followed by one line
# "Screenshots: <path> <path>...", and the JSON also lists them under "images".
# A message may be screenshots alone.
#
# shot captures one whole display (screencapture's -D numbering, 1 = main;
# the main display when omitted) to
#   $FM_HOME/state/desk-voice/shots/<utc-with-microseconds>-<id>.png
# prints that path, and prunes the folder to the newest FM_DESK_SHOTS_KEEP
# (default 30) images. It never delivers anything by itself. The capture
# command is FM_DESK_SHOT_CAPTURE (default screencapture), called as
# <cmd> -x -t png [-D <n>] <file>; tests point it at a stub.
#
# keep, recordings and retry make sure a recording is never lost. The floater
# records into state/desk-voice/recording/ and keeps that audio until its
# words are delivered; when transcription fails, hears nothing in a recording
# worth keeping, or delivery fails, it hands the audio to keep, which moves it
# into state/desk-voice/unsent/ (folder 0700, files 0600) beside a small JSON
# record of its purpose (talk to Firstmate, or dictation), how many attempts
# it has had, and why the last one failed, and prints the saved path. Each
# keep prunes the folder to the newest FM_DESK_UNSENT_KEEP (default 20)
# recordings and drops any older than FM_DESK_UNSENT_DAYS (default 30) days.
# recordings lists them oldest first, one line each:
#   <path> TAB <purpose> TAB <attempts> TAB <saved-at> TAB <last reason>
# retry transcribes the named saved recordings again (every saved one when
# none is named) through bin/fm-deepgram-stt.sh, one at a time under one lock,
# and prints one line each (exit 0):
#   delivered TAB <path> TAB <send outcome>   talk to Firstmate: the words went
#                                         through send above, and the recording
#                                         is removed
#   transcript TAB <path> TAB <text>      dictation: the words on one line, for
#                                         the caller to paste; the recording is
#                                         removed
#   unsent TAB <path> TAB <attempts> TAB <reason>
#                                         still not delivered; kept for later
#   busy TAB <path>                       another retry holds the lock
#   gone TAB <path>                       already delivered or removed
# Only files inside the unsent folder are retried.
#
# Drain moves files to state/desk-voice/processed/ and prints each transcript
# (one JSON object per line with --print, plain text otherwise). The primary
# treats drained text as captain input.
