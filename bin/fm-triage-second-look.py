# fm-triage-second-look.py - the TypeSafe (Jev) engine behind
# bin/fm-triage-second-look.sh.
#
# It reads dropped status lines on stdin, gathers the small amount of task state
# the questions actually name, asks Jev four narrow judgments about every line in
# ONE request, applies the promotion rule in code, and prints the lines that
# should be promoted. The opt-in gate, the home resolution and the hard time
# bound are the bash entry point's; everything from request construction to the
# threshold decision is here.
#
# stdin   one record per line: <task-id> TAB <status-line>
# stdout  one promotion per line: <task-id> TAB <tier> TAB <reason> TAB <status-line>
#         <tier> is alert or digest; <reason> is the +-joined conditions that fired.
# stderr  diagnostics only, never the API key and never a line's content.
#
# Exit 0 when a decision was reached (including "promote nothing"), 2 on any
# failure - no key, timeout, HTTP error, malformed body. The caller treats every
# nonzero exit as "promote nothing", which is exactly today's behaviour, so a
# Jev outage and a Jev that was never configured are the same state.
#
# ESCALATE-ONLY. This engine is only ever handed lines the deterministic
# classifier has already dropped, and the only thing it can print is a promotion.
# There is no output that silences a line, so no answer it returns - and no text
# a worker can write into a status line - can suppress an escalation Firstmate
# would otherwise make. See docs/configuration.md "Status second look".
#
# The API key is read from the environment, else from the home's gitignored
# .env, and never appears in argv, stdout, stderr or any state file. The reader
# below is local on purpose, matching how each other optional capability in this
# repository (Relay, Deepgram) reads its own one key without a shared dependency.
