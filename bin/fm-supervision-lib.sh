# read path testing the record alone then treats that leftover as a live shift:
# the host sentinel keeps supervising an idle home and speaks a repeating
# "supervision down" line into glasses that are on a charger. Requiring the flag
# makes every read path agree with the write path that already assumed it.
#
# Having the record without the flag is a STALE shift, not an armed one, and it
