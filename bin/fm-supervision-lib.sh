# fm_supervision_arm_failure_status <state-dir>
# Reads the durable host-sentinel registration-failure record and populates:
#   FM_SUP_ARM_RECORD       resolved path of the record, set whether or not it exists
#   FM_SUP_ARM_FAILED       true/false - the record exists at all
#   FM_SUP_ARM_FAILURES     recorded consecutive failure count (0 when unreadable)
#   FM_SUP_ARM_RETRY_IN     seconds the retry cooldown still suppresses registration
#   FM_SUP_ARM_RETRY_STALE  true/false - the deadline is unusable, so it suppresses nothing
#
# One snapshot answers every question about the record, so a caller reads the file
# once per operation instead of re-deriving fields through separate wrappers.
#
# The cooldown counts only while retry_at is in the future AND no further away
# than the retry_after_secs recorded atomically beside it. A wall-clock rollback,
# or a state volume restored from a machine whose clock ran ahead, therefore reads
# as stale evidence that suppresses nothing rather than an enormous fake
# suppression window. Both bin/fm-supervision-sentinel.sh (which enforces the
# cooldown) and bin/fm-session-start.sh (which reports it) call this, so the
# displayed window and the enforced window cannot drift apart.
# Always returns 0; callers read the vars.
