# fm-command-guard.py - the opt-in worker command guard: before a spawned
# worker's shell command runs, TypeSafe's Jev judges it, and the command is
# blocked when it would remove, overwrite or send something with no way back,
# when it aims to wipe something, or when it carries text aimed at the judge
# itself.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-command-guard.py hook --config DIR --state DIR --home DIR --task ID --project NAME
#       The Claude Code PreToolUse hook bin/fm-spawn.sh installs for a spawned
#       Claude worker (ship or scout) when this home has opted in. Reads the hook
#       payload on stdin. On a block it prints the documented PreToolUse deny
#       object on stdout; on an allow it prints nothing. It always exits 0.
#   fm-command-guard.py armed --config DIR --project NAME
#       Exit 0 when the guard is on for that project, 1 when it is not. A
#       malformed gate says why on stderr and counts as off. fm-spawn.sh asks this
#       before it writes the hook, and the hook asks it again on every command, so
#       switching the gate off, or excluding a project, takes effect at once.
#   fm-command-guard.py bench FILE
#       Run every labelled command in FILE through the real request and the real
#       rule, one request per command exactly as the hook sends it, and print the
#       answers, each verdict against its label, and the agreement. Needs a key.
#       tests/fixtures/command-guard/benchmark.json is the tracked set; grow it
#       whenever a real block or a real miss teaches something.
#
# OPT-IN, per home, off by default: nothing is installed or sent unless this
# home's private gitignored config/command-guard says `enabled = true`. It is not
# inherited into secondmate homes. happiness-compass is local-only and is never
# guarded or sent, whatever the gate says; projects named on an `exclude` line
# are treated the same way. Both match the project's logical directory name, as
# the registry names it. docs/configuration.md "Worker command guard" owns the
# operator contract.
#
# STEPS ASIDE ON ANY FAILURE. No key, a timeout, an HTTP error, an unreadable
# answer, a malformed gate or a crash all ALLOW the command. The first such
# failure of an episode is written once to the log and stderr, and the next good
# answer ends the episode. The guard never stops work because Jev is down.
#
# REDACTS KNOWN SECRETS. Only the command text leaves the machine, never the
# working directory, the task or the environment. Before it is sent, known
# .env and secret-looking environment values are removed, as described in
# docs/configuration.md. Redaction is best-effort: known keys, tokens,
# password arguments, whole quoted or unquoted, credentialed URLs and
# private-key blocks are replaced; a NAME=value assignment loses its value when
# the name looks secret or the value looks random. It matches text patterns,
# not shell syntax, and every command is judged with whatever it removed.
# Plain values such as paths stay visible, so the judge can see what
# `T=../sibling-copy; rm -rf "$T"` removes.
#
# ONE SIGNAL AMONG SEVERAL. The video this borrows from saw an agent route
# around a write-only gate by writing the same file with a shell heredoc, so
# this guard judges the WHOLE command, heredoc bodies and redirections
# included, and any one condition blocks. To keep each state short, a redacted
# command longer than one part is cut into overlapping parts of at most
# PART_CHARS characters, all sent in ONE request that asks the three questions
# of every part, and any part firing any condition blocks. If that request
# fails (timeout, HTTP error, unusable answer), the guard asks once more about
# the first HEAD_CHARS and last TAIL_CHARS characters alone before it steps
# aside, and the log's `path` names what decided: whole, parts or
# head-and-tail. A command needing more than MAX_PARTS parts is not judged: it
# is allowed, and a warning goes to stderr and the log. Only the Bash tool is judged, so a script written with
# another tool and then run as `bash x.sh` is judged by that short command
# alone. It is still an extra check on a worker that already runs in a
# disposable copy under supervision, not a sandbox.
