# Profiles and exact launch mechanics (this header/help is the single owner):
#   pi            pi --name FIRSTMATE
#                 Pi has no permission system, so no bypass flag exists or is

#                 --dangerously-skip-permissions
#                 Both Claude profiles use the first trimmed line of local
#                 gitignored config/primary-effort when that file exists,
#                 otherwise xhigh.
#                 Accepted tokens: low, medium, high, xhigh, max.
#                 Any other content, including an empty token, refuses.
#                 Exports CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BG_SHELL_PRESSURE_REAP=1 so
#                 Claude Code does not terminate the tracked watcher-arm

#   kimi-k3       kimi --model kimi-code/k3 --yolo
#                 Inside tmux, the launcher adds a detached one-row companion
#                 that renders docs/status-bar.md without replacing Kimi's
#                 native footer or controls.
#   cursor-grok   agent --yolo --model cursor-grok-4.6-high
#                 Cursor has no effort flag; the tier is a model-id suffix.
#                 Grok 4.6 also offers -xhigh, so -high here is a deliberate
#                 cost choice rather than the ceiling it was on Grok 4.5.
#                 Primary lifecycle hooks reuse tracked .claude/settings.json
#                 (Cursor maps SessionStart/PreToolUse/Stop onto its native
#                 events). There is no third-party status-line API, so no
#                 companion status bar is installed.
#
# --account <name> is the ONLY extra argument a profile accepts; every other one
# still refuses, because that refusal exists to keep resume arguments away from
# the launched CLI.
# It pins the launch to a NAMED VENDOR ACCOUNT: the Claude profiles take a claude
# account, exported as CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, and the Codex-backed profiles codex and
# astra take a codex account, exported as CODEX_HOME. A profile whose vendor has no account concept (pi,
# opencode, grok, kimi-k3, cursor-grok) refuses --account rather than ignoring it.
# Accounts are named in local, gitignored config/accounts.json (docs/configuration.md
# owns that schema) and their homes are DERIVED as data/accounts/<vendor>/<name>,
# never read from that file. Omitting the flag uses that vendor's default when the
# file names one. With NO such file there is no pinning at all: every profile's
# argv and environment are exactly what they were before account pinning existed.
# A file that exists but cannot be read warns and launches on the ambient account,
# and refuses only an explicit --account it cannot resolve.
#
# A pinned account home is created and logged in by the CAPTAIN, never by this
# launcher: bin/fm-account.sh create <vendor> <name> makes the empty home and
# prints the login command. No credential directory, auth.json, .credentials.json,
# or keychain entry is ever copied, linked, or seeded between homes. A pinned home
# that does not exist or is explicitly logged out refuses the launch and names the
# exact login command to run; that refusal is the correct outcome, not a failure.
# An account that declares an expect identity is verified against the home before
# exec, and a mismatch refuses naming both the wanted and the actual identity, so
# a pinned session can never silently run on another seat.
#
# Two Claude seats coexist on one machine, proven 2026-09-09 on claude 2.1.258 by
# logging a second seat in: Claude Code NAMESPACES its keychain item per config
# directory, so that login added "Claude Code-credentials-<hash>" beside the
# original item and left the ambient seat untouched. Both then report logged in at
# once, and neither home holds a .credentials.json. A pinned home is unauthenticated
# only until its own login, which is why an unauthenticated pin refuses with the
# login command instead of launching. Codex isolates a different way, through the
# auth.json inside CODEX_HOME.
# Two seats can share one email address, so an email is not enough to tell them
# apart; the org and plan are. That is what an account's expect value is for.
#
# Aliases: claude -> claude-fable; opus -> claude-opus; kimi -> kimi-k3;
# cursor -> cursor-grok.
# The aliases are primary-launch conveniences only.
# They never change config/crew-harness, config/secondmate-harness, dispatch
# profiles, or fm-spawn's independently verified worker-adapter set.
#
# Every launch dereferences up to 40 absolute or relative symlink hops from the
# invoked command, resolves the repository root from the resulting tracked
# script, changes to that root, refuses another live Firstmate lock holder,
# checks the selected CLI and its tracked primary integrations, installs only
# that profile's guarded status-bar surface, marks only the current terminal
# surface, then execs the CLI so sessions persist normally and the CLI exit
# status is returned with no launcher process left behind.
# Codex-backed profiles (codex and astra) refuse an explicitly logged-out
# Codex CLI, which would otherwise boot the primary to a login screen.
# Codex prints that negative on stderr and exits non-zero, so the gate reads the
# merged stream and still blocks on the message alone, never on the exit status.
# When local config/primary-handoff is present and enabled, a real launch also
# writes state/.primary-active for bin/fm-primary-handoff.sh; disabled or absent
# config leaves that marker unwritten (docs/primary-handoff.md).
#
# Kimi is verified as a PRIMARY here and, separately, as a WORKER via
# fm-spawn --harness kimi (docs/kimi-harness.md, 2026-07-23).
# Two builds are accepted without a warning, and they are deliberately different
# values: KIMI_CERTIFIED_VERSION is the last full primary certification, which is
# what docs/toolchain-manifest.tsv's kimi row transcribes, and
# KIMI_VALIDATED_VERSION is the newer build whose primary hook mechanics were
# re-verified without a full certification. Both are named below, and the launch
# check is set membership rather than one equality: once those two legitimately
# differ, a single exact-match test cannot express "unevidenced" and would always
# report one of the two accepted builds as unevidenced.
# Any other installed version WARNS and launches anyway; it does not block.
# Kimi ships a self-updater, so an exact-equality gate in front of it turned
# every publisher release into an unscheduled outage of the certified primary
# rather than a merely uncertified one - the same reasoning bin/fm-toolchain-lib.sh
# applies fleet-wide. The functional gate that remains is `kimi doctor` against
# the managed home, which fails the launch when the integration is actually
# broken instead of when a version string merely moved.
# The launcher builds a persistent isolated KIMI_CODE_HOME under this Firstmate
# home's data directory.
# It copies the selected source config, links only required authentication and
# user-resource paths, and installs a managed Firstmate plugin there.
# Kimi's ordinary SessionStart hook discards stdout; the plugin's native
# sessionStart.skill is the model-context nudge on startup, resume, and /new.
# Its hooks provide blockable PreToolUse and Stop integration.
# The source Kimi home and its live config are never edited.
#
# Cursor CLI primary support records the empirically certified agent version
# below and in docs/cursor-harness.md; any other build warns and launches.
# The launch check that can still refuse is an explicitly logged-out CLI, which
# would otherwise boot the primary to a login screen.
# Worker adapter behavior is unchanged; this profile certifies PRIMARY only.
# Never launch a cursor WORKER from the primary checkout (that checkout's
# .claude/settings.json Stop wiring is for the primary session).
#
# --install-shim creates ~/.local/bin/firstmate as a symlink to this command.
# It is idempotent only for that exact symlink and refuses every other existing
# file or symlink.
#
# Test seams:
#   FM_PRIMARY_DRY_RUN=1 prints selected profile env lines and one
#   shell-escaped argv line instead of exec.
#   It exits before the ACCOUNT login and identity gates, so a pinned launch's
#   preview always prints argv. The preview still resolves and prints the
#   account, because an unresolvable pin is a bad request rather than a missing
#   credential. This is a statement about account pinning only: the Codex and
#   Cursor profiles keep their own login gates exactly where they already were.
#   FM_PRIMARY_VISIBLE_PREFIX=LAB is accepted only inside a named fm-lab-*
#   Herdr session and visibly prefixes the role so a lab can never masquerade
#   as the captain's FIRSTMATE.
