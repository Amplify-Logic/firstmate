# Claude Stop hook that speaks the primary's final reply through desk voice-out.
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "async": true, so the turn ends at once and this runs in the background.
# It carries out AGENTS.md section 9's voice-out duty on a Claude primary: the
# model writes its reply's opening lead for the ear, and this hook speaks that
# lead whenever the model did not speak a line itself during the turn.
#
# What it speaks: the reply's opening lead (AGENTS.md section 9), taken from the
# Stop payload's `last_assistant_message`, which is the exact final reply:
#   - a leading routine "Captain, shipshape." is dropped first, so that line is
#     never spoken and the news after it is;
#   - only the first plain paragraph, with headings, tables, fenced code, and
#     rules dropped, and list markers, emphasis, backticks, and link targets
#     stripped, because the register would otherwise read pipes and code aloud;
#   - split into sentences only at . ! or ? (optionally closed by a quote or
#     bracket) followed by a word that opens with a capital, a digit, or an
#     opening quote or bracket, so "5.5" and "0.9.1" stay whole;
#   - a closing sentence ending in ":" introduces a list on screen, so it is
#     dropped when another sentence precedes it and ended with "." when it is
#     the only one;
#   - at most 3 sentences and 38 words (about 35, with slack so a lead written
#     to AGENTS.md section 9 is never cut), cut back to the last whole sentence;
#     a first sentence longer than that is kept whole for the register to cut;
#   - ended with "." when it does not already end in . ! or ?;
#   - followed by one voice-only pointer, first match wins, unless the lead
#     already says "on screen", "see below", "is below", or "are below": "The
#     choice is on screen." when the rest of the reply offers lettered options
#     (a line opening "A." or "**A.**"), says "Say A, B ..." or "you choose", or
#     asks for a quoted reply such as Say "land it"; "There's a question for you
#     on screen." when a later paragraph ends with "?"; "The steps are on
#     screen." when the rest holds a numbered list; "More on screen." when the
#     rest holds more than a one-line sign-off of at most 15 words (another
#     paragraph or line, a list, a table, code, or a link) or the cuts above
#     dropped anything. The desk budget (docs/examples/desk-speak-register.toml)
#     is 41 words, and the lead is cut back further so that it and the pointer
#     fit, because past the budget the register drops the pointer sentence.
# When the register refuses the line (bin/fm-speak.sh exit 2), the hook speaks
# only the lead's first sentence plus the pointer, or plus "The choice is on
# screen." or "More on screen." when there was none. When that is refused too,
# or the lead was a single sentence, it speaks "Captain, a decision is waiting
# for you on screen." or "Captain, my reply is on screen." A decision is named
# only when a refusal reason said the line asked the captain to decide AND the
# reply itself agrees: the rest offers a choice, a question, or steps, or the
# lead asks a question. The reason is the register's own "refused: <reason>"
# line, which bin/fm-speak.sh passes to stderr. No path ever puts a choice to
# the captain by voice.
#
# What stays silent:
#   - an empty or missing `last_assistant_message`, such as a turn that ended on
#     tool calls only;
#   - the routine no-news reply: exactly "Captain, shipshape." after trimming,
#     so a bare routine update costs no speech;
#   - a turn in which bin/fm-speak.sh already handed a line over: the hook
#     records the newest reply number in state/speak-history/ (numbers only
#     grow) after each Stop it accounts for, including after its own speech, and
#     a different number at the next Stop means someone spoke during this turn.
#     Its own speech therefore never silences the next turn;
#   - a Stop superseded by a newer Stop: each Stop writes a fresh token to
#     state/.reply-speak-stop, waits FM_REPLY_SPEAK_SETTLE_MS (default 2000),
#     and speaks only while its token is still the latest. That drops the
#     mid-turn line when another Stop hook blocked the stop and a newer Stop
#     arrived within the settle window. A continuation that runs longer than the
#     window can still speak both lines; the final reply is then spoken as well,
#     because the hook's own speech is not counted as the model's.
#   - a muted or not-opted-in home: bin/fm-speak.sh owns both and exits 0
#     without a sound.
#
# Scope, so workers never speak: every worktree of this repo loads the same
# tracked settings, so the hook runs only in the plain primary checkout (not a
# linked crew or scout worktree, and not a secondmate home, whose chat the
# captain does not read) AND only when this session's harness ancestry holds the
# home session lock - the same scope and identity tests
# bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh uses, without its stale-lock recovery. A
# Cursor-delivered payload stands down through bin/fm-hook-host-lib.sh, and the
# settings entry's GROK_* guard keeps it inert under Grok.
#
# Never blocks and never prints: every path exits 0 with no stdout, and
# bin/fm-speak.sh's diagnostics are read only for the refusal reason, then
# discarded.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests and unusual layouts:
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_CMD           speak command (default: bin/fm-speak.sh)
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_SETTLE_MS     wait before the superseded check (default 2000)
#   FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE, FM_HOME, FM_STATE_OVERRIDE  as for the other hooks
