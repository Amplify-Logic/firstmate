# Claude Stop hook that speaks the primary's final reply through desk voice-out.
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "async": true, so the turn ends at once and this runs in the background.
# It is the structural backstop behind AGENTS.md section 9's voice-out duty: the
# model is still asked to speak its own shortened line, and this hook speaks the
# final reply whenever the model did not.
#
# What it speaks: the Stop payload's `last_assistant_message`, which is the exact
# final reply, reduced to a spoken line before bin/fm-speak.sh shapes it:
#   - only the first plain paragraph, with headings, tables, fenced code, and
#     rules dropped, and list markers, emphasis, backticks, and link targets
#     stripped, because the register would otherwise read pipes and code aloud;
#   - at most FM_REPLY_SPEAK_MAX_WORDS words (default 60), cut back to the last
#     full sentence inside that cap when one exists.
# When the register refuses the line (bin/fm-speak.sh exit 2, which is how it
# refuses a line that asks the captain to decide), the hook speaks the fixed
# notice "Captain, a decision is waiting for you on screen." instead, so the
# captain still hears that the screen needs him without the choice being put to
# him by voice.
#
# What stays silent:
#   - an empty or missing `last_assistant_message`, such as a turn that ended on
#     tool calls only;
#   - the routine no-news reply: a reply that opens with "Captain, shipshape."
#     and has no more than FM_REPLY_SPEAK_ROUTINE_WORDS words in total (default
#     12), so a bare routine update costs no speech;
#   - a turn in which bin/fm-speak.sh already handed a line over: the hook
#     records a signature of state/speak-last (mtime plus checksum) after each
#     Stop it accounts for, including after its own speech, and a different
#     signature at the next Stop means someone spoke during this turn. Its own
#     speech therefore never silences the next turn;
#   - a Stop superseded by a newer Stop: each Stop writes a fresh token to
#     state/.reply-speak-stop, waits FM_REPLY_SPEAK_SETTLE_MS (default 2000),
#     and speaks only while its token is still the latest. That drops the
#     mid-turn line when another Stop hook blocked the stop and a newer Stop
#     arrived within the settle window. A continuation that runs longer than the
#     window can still speak both lines; the final reply is then spoken as well,
#     because the hook's own speech is not counted as the model's.
#   - a muted or not-opted-in home: bin/fm-speak.sh owns both and exits 0
#     without a sound.
#
# Scope, so workers never speak: every worktree of this repo loads the same
# tracked settings, so the hook runs only in the plain primary checkout (not a
# linked crew or scout worktree, and not a secondmate home, whose chat the
# captain does not read) AND only when this session's harness ancestry holds the
# home session lock - the same scope and identity tests
# bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh uses, without its stale-lock recovery. A
# Cursor-delivered payload stands down through bin/fm-hook-host-lib.sh, and the
# settings entry's GROK_* guard keeps it inert under Grok.
#
# Never blocks and never prints: every path exits 0 with no stdout, and
# bin/fm-speak.sh's diagnostics are discarded.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests and unusual layouts:
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_CMD           speak command (default: bin/fm-speak.sh)
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_SETTLE_MS     wait before the superseded check (default 2000)
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_MAX_WORDS     spoken word cap (default 60)
#   FM_REPLY_SPEAK_ROUTINE_WORDS routine shipshape word bound (default 12)
#   FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE, FM_HOME, FM_STATE_OVERRIDE  as for the other hooks
