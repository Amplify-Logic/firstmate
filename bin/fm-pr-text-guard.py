# fm-pr-text-guard.py - the worker PR text check: before a spawned Claude
# worker publishes text to a public repository's pull requests, it refuses the
# command when the text holds a word from this home's private word list.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-pr-text-guard.py hook --home DIR
#       The Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Bash that bin/fm-spawn.sh installs
#       for every spawned Claude worker (ship or scout). Reads the hook payload
#       on stdin. On a refusal it prints the documented PreToolUse deny object
#       on stdout; on an allow it prints nothing. It always exits 0.
#
# docs/configuration.md "Private leak words" owns the operator contract. The
# word list, its format and where it is found belong to bin/fm-leak-guard.sh,
# whose --text mode this hook runs with FM_HOME set to DIR; this file never
# reads the list itself.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED. Only a Bash command that publishes text: gh or gh-axi
# `pr|issue create|new|edit|comment|review|close|reopen|merge`, a `gh api` call that sends
# fields or an input file, and `no-mistakes axi run|respond`, whose intent and
# answers reach the PR the pipeline writes. Every other command passes
# untouched, and so does every other tool. The text checked is the whole
# command, so inline titles, bodies, heredocs and variables set earlier in the
# same command all count, plus every existing file the command names anywhere:
# a body or input flag, a redirect, a `cat` or `$(cat ...)`, or a pipe into
# `--body-file -`. A listed word in a path or branch name of such a command is
# refused too, because a branch name is published. A `pr create` or `pr new` given
# --fill, -f, --fill-first or --fill-verbose before the next shell operator
# takes its text from commit messages this check cannot see, so on a public
# repository it is refused whenever the home has a list.
#
# PUBLIC ONLY. A private repository may hold these words, so a hit is refused
# unless every repository the command could reach is proven private. When the
# command calls gh or gh-axi as a word of its own, or names a publishing gh
# form that is not part of a no-mistakes command, those repositories are every
# --repo/-R value, GH_REPO= value, PR or issue URL argument and
# repos/<owner>/<repo> path among its words, plus gh's own default for the
# working directory, which `gh repo view` reads there. A gh form named only
# inside quoted text of a no-mistakes command, such as its intent, adds none.
# For `no-mistakes axi run|respond`, the repository is the owner/repo of the
# origin remote, whether its host is github.com or a dotless SSH alias; an
# origin on any other dotted host is not checked, and one that cannot be
# parsed is refused. A command whose words cannot be parsed while it names a
# gh form, often because of an unmatched quote in a heredoc or comment, counts
# as possibly public and is refused, naming the listed words, so the worker
# rewrites the text without them, or drops such comments and passes the text
# with --body-file <file> and an explicit --repo. Such a command that names a
# `pr create` or `pr new` form and a standalone --fill flag counts as --fill.
# A repository whose visibility cannot be
# read, and an origin that cannot be parsed, count as possibly public too: the
# refusal names the words and that repository, and tells the worker to rewrite
# the text without them, or to append a blocked: status line and stop when the
# repository is private and still cannot be read. The visibility read happens
# only after a hit, so a clean command costs no network call.
#
# FAILURES. No list means nothing is checked, exactly as before the list
# existed: bin/fm-leak-guard.sh --text says nothing at all then. An
# unreadable payload passes, because it cannot be known to publish anything.
# Once a command is known to publish, any failure inside the check refuses it.
