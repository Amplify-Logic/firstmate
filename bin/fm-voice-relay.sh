# fm-voice-relay.sh - the deterministic freshness, evidence, and presentation
# ledger for the spoken desktop-companion relay.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES: a spoken relay turn is a pipeline of queued messages
# with no shared clock. The companion is still reading a message the captain has
# already corrected, a queue item arrives after the thing it asks for succeeded,
# and the only record of "what is current" lives in a conversation that compacts.
# The observed failures were all one bug: an instruction was acted on, or spoken,
# long after it stopped being true - a stale sign-in password step re-read after
# the sign-in already succeeded, a prior answer repeated as if new, and a queue
# receipt reported as though the work had happened.
#
# So every decision here is a DISK decision. A step is performed only after this
# ledger says its revision is still current; a sentence is spoken only after this
# ledger says that exact sentence has not already been spoken for that topic.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT:
#   - Not a backend, not a second fleet manager, not a command gateway: it runs
#     no command for anyone, sends no message, and speaks nothing. It answers
#     "is this still current?" and records what happened.
#   - Not the steering transport. Delivering a correction into a turn that is
#     already running is a real, supported operation, but it belongs to the
#     app-server protocol and lives in bin/fm-voice-relay-appserver.sh
#     (turn/steer, turn/interrupt). This ledger decides WHETHER something is
#     still current; that adapter delivers the correction.
#   - Not a hard cancellation, even with that adapter. A turn can be steered or
#     interrupted; a tool call already executing, a command already run, and any
#     effect already produced outside these gates cannot be recalled. The
#     guarantee here is cooperative and bounded: a caller that asks before each
#     not-yet-performed step and before each presentation cannot act on or speak
#     a superseded revision. `begin` records an in-flight step exactly so a
#     correction reports honestly what is past the point of recall, instead of
#     implying it was killed.
#   - Not proof of speech. `present` records that text was released to the
#     speaking frontend. No receipt here means audio was produced or heard.
#
# OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES (do not re-implement them here):
#   docs/desktop-companion.md   what the companion is, its setup, its transport,
#                               and the accepted/picked-up/completed distinction.
#   docs/codex-app-backend.md   why `codex-app` is still not a backend.
#   bin/fm-path-lib.sh          durable-directory resolution.
#
# STATE: private, per-home, under $FM_HOME/state/voice-relay (0700). Nothing here
# is tracked, and no session identifier, path, or account value reaches a tracked
# file. A home that never runs this script has no directory and pays nothing.
#
# CONCURRENCY: every state-changing write is a publish-once same-directory hard
# link of a completed temporary file, so two racing callers cannot both win and
# the loser fails closed with a conflict. Revisions advance by link-once too, so
# the current revision is derived from what exists rather than from a mutable
# pointer that a crash could leave half-written. Receipts, once published, are
# never rewritten: a duplicate reads the existing bytes and a mismatch is
# refused with the original untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-voice-relay.sh bind --companion <id> --primary <id> --home <codex-home>
#         --dir <authorized shared directory>
#       Record the exact enrolled session pair this home may talk to. A second
#       bind archives the previous one and invalidates it: every request created
#       under the old binding is refused from then on, so a replaced session can
#       never be answered on its old target. This script never discovers,
#       lists, or guesses a session; the caller supplies verified identifiers.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh binding
#       Print the current binding. Exit 1 when none is bound.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh open <topic> --summary <text>
#       Start topic <topic> at revision 1 and print "<request-id> <revision>".
#       The request id is topic-scoped and stable across revisions; corrections
#       advance the revision of the SAME request rather than opening a new one.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh revise <topic> --summary <text> [--expect-revision <n>]
#       Record a correction: the next revision of the same request. Every older
#       revision is superseded from this moment. --expect-revision makes the
#       advance a compare-and-swap, so a caller working from a stale read is
#       refused instead of overwriting someone else's correction.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh cancel <topic> --reason <text>
#       Stop the topic. Not a rollback: steps already performed stay performed
#       and stay in the evidence. Only not-yet-performed steps are refused.
#       An in-flight step is reported as uninterruptible, not as stopped.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh complete <topic> --revision <n> [--outcome <text>]
#       Record the topic's success at that revision and retire every declared
#       step that has not been performed. This is the sign-in case: success
#       retires the pending password and clipboard substeps of THIS topic, and
#       touches no other topic.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh step <topic> --step <slug> [--step <slug>]...
#       Declare substeps of the current revision so success can retire them.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh check-action <topic> --revision <n> [--step <slug>]
#       THE GATE TO CALL BEFORE PERFORMING ANYTHING. Prints one verdict line and
#       exits with its code (see EXIT CODES). Nothing is recorded.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh begin <topic> --revision <n> --step <slug>
#       Claim a step for execution after check-action cleared it. The claim is
#       publish-once, so a step cannot be executed twice by racing callers, and
#       it marks the step in-flight for honest correction reporting.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh performed <topic> --revision <n> --step <slug> [--note <text>]
#       Record that the step actually happened. Permanent: a later cancellation
#       or correction never deletes it.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh phase <topic> --revision <n> --phase <phase> [--note <text>]
#         [--message-id <id>] [--turn-id <id>] [--queue-exit <n>]
#       Append one evidence line. Phases are kept distinct on purpose:
#         enqueued    the queue command accepted the message. NOTHING ELSE.
#         picked-up   the companion actually began a turn on it.
#         working     the companion reported progress inside that turn.
#         completed   the companion persisted and read back its result.
#         failed      the turn ended without the result.
#         superseded  a correction overtook this revision.
#         cancelled   the topic was stopped.
#         presented   text was released to the speaking frontend (not audio).
#       The revision and binding are checked as the action gate checks them, so
#       nothing can be recorded against a request that was never opened. A
#       non-zero --queue-exit records a FAILED handoff rather than an enqueue.
#       A record counts as transport evidence only when it carries the proof for
#       its phase - a queue message id for an enqueue, a turn id for a pickup;
#       everything else is stored as an operator claim and reported as one.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh handoff <topic> --revision <n>
#       Authorize the handoff ONCE. The first call says send it now; every
#       later call reports the authorization that already exists instead of
#       asking again, which is what ends the "shall I send it?" loop. This
#       command never sends anything itself.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh accept <topic> --revision <n> --answer <path>
#         --sha256 <hex> --receipt <path>
#       Completion acceptance, separate from execution and from presentation.
#       Validates the answer is a regular non-symlink file inside the bound
#       authorized directory, recomputes its SHA-256, and publishes the
#       immutable receipt once. An identical repeat is "duplicate" and changes
#       nothing; any disagreement in id, hash, or revision is "conflict",
#       refused, with the existing receipt left byte-identical.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh present <topic> --revision <n> --outcome <text>
#         [--limitation <text>] [--question <text>] [--allow-repeat] [--final]
#         --attribution <companion-observed|firstmate-verified|mixed>
#       THE GATE TO CALL BEFORE SPEAKING. Refuses a superseded, cancelled, or
#       unknown revision; suppresses an exact repeat and pure filler; otherwise
#       prints the sentence to speak and records the presentation once. The
#       template is deliberately short - outcome, one material limitation, one
#       question - because everything else belongs in the text artifact.
#       A finished topic speaks only through --final, which announces how it
#       ended: any other sentence about finished work is stale by construction.
#       --attribution is required so a companion observation is never reported
#       as a Firstmate finding, or the other way round.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh sent-status <topic> [--revision <n>] [--all]
#       Answer "did you send it?" from what is recorded. It never re-sends and
#       never infers: an accepted-but-unconfirmed send is reported as exactly
#       that, which is the whole point of keeping enqueued separate. It answers
#       for the CURRENT revision unless one is named, so a corrected request
#       never reports the fate of the instruction it replaced, and it reports a
#       turn as confirmed only when the record carries the transport's own turn
#       id - an operator's typed pickup stays an unconfirmed claim.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh pending
#       The logical pending count, evidence-backed: one line per open topic
#       with its current revision, its declared-but-unperformed steps, and its
#       last recorded phase. Revisions are grouped, so a request corrected
#       twice counts once rather than three times. Native queue depth and
#       audible playback are printed as unknown, because they are unknown.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh pref set <key> --value <text>
#         --source <captain-confirmed|companion-proposal> [--scope <text>]
#   fm-voice-relay.sh pref show <key> | forget <key> | list | render
#       Inspect, edit and forget the companion-scoped style record. Keys are
#       confined to speech., style., detail. and format., and no gate in this
#       script ever reads one, which is the structural reason a preference can
#       never widen execution authority. Each record carries its value, source,
#       scope, revision and supersession; a record written under a replaced
#       binding is reported as invalidated rather than silently inherited.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh steer-command <topic> --revision <n> --turn <turn-id>
#       Print the exact bin/fm-voice-relay-appserver.sh command that delivers
#       this revision's correction into the turn running now, with the bound
#       thread and the turn id filled in, so no caller hand-assembles a target.
#       Refuses for a superseded, retired, or unbound revision.
#
#   fm-voice-relay.sh evidence <topic>
#       The per-phase table with UTC timestamps, the gap between phases, and the
#       observable handoff and turn counts. Latencies are wall-clock between
#       recorded events; no cost, saving, or audio claim is derived from them.
#
# EXIT CODES (stable; the verdict word is always the first token of stdout):
#   0  ok / fresh / duplicate acceptance that changed nothing
#   2  usage error
#   3  superseded    a newer revision of this request exists
#   4  unknown-revision  that revision was never opened
#   5  retired       the topic already completed, or was cancelled
#   6  already-performed  that step is done; doing it again is the stale-step bug
#   7  binding-replaced   the request belongs to a binding that no longer exists
#   8  duplicate-suppressed | filler-suppressed  that exact sentence was already
#                    released for presentation, or it carries no outcome at all
#   9  conflict      an id, hash, or revision disagreed; nothing was written,
#                    a record already exists, and repeating the call will not help
#  10  write-failed  the record could not be written at all; nothing was stored,
#                    so the work still has to happen or be escalated
#  11  steps-not-retired  the completion itself was stored and stands, but the
#                    named pending substeps could not be retired; they must be
#                    retired or re-declared by hand. Completing again answers 5
