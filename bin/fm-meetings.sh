# fm-meetings.sh - turn finished personal meetings recorded by Anarlog, and
# glasses calls shared to an iCloud Drive folder, into Starship work.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-meetings.sh check               the standing watcher check (bounded poll, one line)
#   fm-meetings.sh arm                 write and register state/meetings.check.sh
#   fm-meetings.sh disarm              remove the check shim and its trust binding
#   fm-meetings.sh poll                one unbounded poll, printing what check would print
#   fm-meetings.sh intake [<id>...]    take in every meeting the check announced, or the named ones
#   fm-meetings.sh recall <words>...   what was said or agreed: a person, topic or title
#   fm-meetings.sh status              every tracked meeting and shared file, and any standing problem
#   fm-meetings.sh --help
#
# Anarlog (anarlog.so) records the meeting on this Mac and keeps it in its own
# local database. This layer reads it only through Anarlog's own command-line
# tool (`anarlog --json meetings ...`, local source) and never opens that
# database itself. The one thing it asks Anarlog to add is a recording import,
# through Anarlog's supported `meetings import` command, which needs the
# desktop app open on the same database.
#
# THE CHECK. `arm` writes state/meetings.check.sh, a byte-static shim that runs
# `check`, and binds it with fm-check-register.sh, so the watcher runs it on its
# slow-check cadence and turns its one printed line into a `check:` wake. The
# line starts `meetings:` and names each meeting that became ready for intake
# since the last poll, once, plus any problem worth a wake, once until it
# clears. `arm` also records the arming time: a meeting that ended before it is
# left alone (intake can still take one in by id). The poll must finish inside
# the watcher's per-check bound (FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT, default 30); unfinished work
# carries over to the next poll.
#
# WHEN A RECORDING IS FINISHED. A recorded meeting counts once Anarlog shows an
# end time, has no capture still pending, nothing changed for two minutes, and
# its summary exists or ten minutes have passed. Anarlog's live model (Parakeet
# Streaming) writes the transcript during the call; Anarlog runs its Batch
# model (Parakeet Batch, which labels speakers) after the call on its own only
# when the live transcript broke off or the meeting has two or more remote
# participants. So:
#   - a transcript Anarlog already rewrote with its Batch pass is used as is;
#   - otherwise the meeting's own recording is always imported through
#     `anarlog meetings import` as a second meeting titled "<title> (speaker
#     pass)", which Anarlog transcribes after the call with its Batch model, and
#     its transcript is the one the intake reads;
#   - the live transcript is used only when no recording was kept, or the
#     speaker pass failed or did not finish within speaker_pass_wait_minutes;
#     the intake's outcome then says so.
#
# GLASSES CALLS. Audio exported from a phone app into `glasses_folder` (default
# iCloud Drive/Starship calls) is imported into Anarlog the same way once the
# file has stopped changing for a minute; Anarlog transcribes it with its Batch
# model, in whichever of its configured spoken languages it hears (add Dutch
# next to English in Anarlog's Language & Region settings for Dutch calls), and
# the imported meeting then flows through the same intake once Anarlog's
# summary of it is in, or ten minutes after its transcript. iCloud placeholders
# are asked to download first. Files in the folder are never moved or deleted;
# non-audio files are listed by `status` and skipped.
#
# INTAKE. `intake` takes in each announced meeting once:
#   - Work meetings stay out. A meeting whose title, participants, notes,
#     summary or transcript match a work word (each `work_marker`, plus every
#     line of the private config/meeting-work-words, one word or phrase per
#     line with `#` comments; neither ships with any word) is never sent to a
#     model or actioned; intake prints only `work meeting, not processed:
#     <title>`.
#   - Otherwise one model pass (`claude -p`, no tools, no session) reads a
#     bounded copy of the meeting: Anarlog's summary, the captain's own notes,
#     action items and the transcript, capped at transcript_chars characters.
#   - Paragraphs where someone says "Firstmate, do it", "Firstmate, build that"
#     or "captain's order" are found first and handed to the model as
#     spoken-order candidates. They are read from the meeting's own transcript,
#     where Anarlog labels the captain's speech (the live one when a speaker
#     pass ran). One said under the captain's own speaker label counts as a
#     clear action; one said by another labelled speaker, or where the
#     transcript never labels the captain (so it could not tell who said it),
#     stays for review.
#   - Each outcome is sorted in two. A clear, low-risk, internal follow-up whose
#     quoted source is found in the meeting goes to firstmate as ready-to-start
#     work: one inbox note per meeting (`fm-inbox.sh note --request-id
#     meeting-<id>-start`). Everything else - needing review or refinement,
#     outward-facing (an instruction to send, reply, email, message, post,
#     publish, pay, buy, sign, invite or call someone), destructive (delete or
#     remove), touching another person's commitment, or whose
#     source cannot be found - goes in a second note (`meeting-<id>-review`)
#     for firstmate to put on the captain's phone tap page, where it waits.
#     This layer itself sends nothing anywhere outside this Mac's own inbox.
#   - One spoken line goes to the desk through fm-speak.sh (inert unless the
#     home turned desk voice on), and the record is kept in
#     data/meetings/<id>/intake.json, which `recall` searches.
# A failed intake leaves the meeting ready for the next `intake`, and after
# three failures marks it failed. The request ids make a repeated intake reuse
# its notes rather than file them twice.
#
# RECALL. `recall` answers "what did we agree with <person>" from the intake
# records and Anarlog's title search, leaving out work meetings, and prints
# date, title, people, outcome, follow-ups and Anarlog's own action items and
# summary for the asker to answer from. Anarlog's own MCP server (`anarlog
# mcp`) is the richer route for an agent that has it connected.
#
# CONFIG. Optional, private, gitignored config/meetings: `key = value` lines,
# `#` comments; an unknown key is refused. docs/examples/meetings lists every
# key with its default:
#   speaker_pass_wait_minutes  how long to wait for the speaker pass before using the live transcript (180)
#   glasses_folder             the shared-audio folder, or off
#   work_marker                a work word or phrase; repeatable
#   self_label                 another transcript label that is the captain; repeatable
#   intake_model               the Claude model for the intake (sonnet)
#   transcript_chars           how much of the meeting the model reads (60000)
#
# RECORDS. state/meetings/records.json (what each meeting and shared file has
# reached; locked, written by rename), state/meetings/check-problem (the last
# failed or timed-out check line, so it wakes once until a poll succeeds) and
# data/meetings/<id>/intake.json.
