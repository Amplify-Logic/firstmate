# fm-install-baby-menu-quota.sh - install the tracked Baby Menu quota widget into
# a Baby Menu home.
#
# Copies assets/baby-menu/weekly-quota/ into <home>/extensions/weekly-quota/ and
# seeds an example machine-local settings file. Baby Menu watches its extensions
# directory and rebuilds the widget itself, so no restart is issued here and the
# running app is never started, stopped, or otherwise driven by this script.
#
# What it will not do:
#   - touch any other extension, the app bundle, preferences, credentials, or the
#     app database
#   - overwrite an existing <home>/weekly-quota.local.json (that file is the
#     machine's own setting and is never tracked)
#   - carry any source machine's paths: the tracked sources contain none
#
# Re-running is safe. When an installed widget already differs from the tracked
# sources, the previous copy is kept as
# <home>/backups/weekly-quota-backup-<UTC timestamp>.<unique>/ before it is
# replaced. Each replacing install gets its own backup directory, so one never
# lands inside another.
#
# Backups live OUTSIDE <home>/extensions/ on purpose. Baby Menu's widget
# discovery walks every subdirectory of extensions/, dot-prefixed or not, and
# registers each widget.tsx it finds under the first path segment as an
# extension id, so a backup kept anywhere inside extensions/ renders as a second
# copy of the whole quota panel. An earlier release of this installer kept its
# backups at <home>/extensions/.weekly-quota-backup-*; every re-run relocates
# any such directory to <home>/backups/ unchanged (dropping only the leading
# dot), so a home with the duplicate converges on the next install without
# losing the backed-up copy. Nothing else under extensions/ is moved.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-install-baby-menu-quota.sh [--home <baby-menu-home>] [--dry-run] [--force]
#   fm-install-baby-menu-quota.sh --help
#
# Options:
#   --home <dir>  Baby Menu home to install into. Default: $BABY_MENU_HOME, else
#                 ~/.baby-menu. The directory must already exist - Baby Menu
#                 creates it on first run, and creating it here would hide a
#                 typo'd path as a silently successful install.
#   --dry-run     Report what would change and write nothing.
#   --force       Reinstall even when the installed files already match.
#
# Exit status is non-zero when the home is missing, a copy fails, or a legacy
# backup inside extensions/ could not be moved out (the install itself still
# completes; the warning names the directory to move by hand).
