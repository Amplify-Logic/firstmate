#
# WHAT THIS IS. A LOCAL GATE AND LEDGER ONLY. It never reads a source system,
# never opens a network connection, never spawns an agent, never sends a
# message, and never takes the per-home session lock or the watcher lock. It
# decides WHEN a source is worth reading, remembers WHAT has already been seen,
# and renders WHAT the captain still owes. An orchestrator does the actual
# connector read through its own authenticated path and reports back here.
#
# This is the repeat-poll sibling of bin/fm-morning-intake.sh. That gate is
# once per local day: after a day completes its `run` returns early, so a short
# scheduler interval only re-checks a satisfied day gate. This gate is per
# source and per interval instead, which is the whole reason it exists rather
# than being a shorter cadence on the morning gate. Everything else - the
# private mutex over its own record, the durable armed state, the single wake
# per armed cycle, the registered watcher check, and the rule that a watermark
# advances only behind captured output - is deliberately the same discipline.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It writes nothing the Action Deck renders. An item classified
# `automation-candidate` is a PROPOSAL in the brief and nothing more: detecting
# that some device or account needs an action grants no permission to perform
# it, and this gate has no path that prepares, stages, or fires one. Executable
# deck cards stay with the action gateway and its per-action approval.
#
# DELIVERY. Two surfaces, both captain-private, neither of them sent from here:
#   `notify-due` renders ONE grouped, rate-limited, quiet-hours-aware private
#   direct-message payload and prints it. It does not send. The orchestrator
#   sends it on the configured recipient and then calls `notify-sent`, which is
#   what actually stamps the items. So an interrupted send re-renders rather
#   than being silently swallowed.
#   `brief` and `todo` render from the ledger every time, so a correction, a
#   resolution and a completed obligation reconcile across both by construction
#   instead of needing a second reconciliation pass.
#   Opening a rendered page is OPT-IN and never automatic. `--open` is what a
#   captain-requested render passes, and it is the only thing that opens
#   anything; a scheduled or background render always omits it, always
#   overwrites the same `--out` path, and never takes focus. The open is a
#   convenience on top of a render that already succeeded, so a missing or
#   failing opener is reported and the command still exits 0.
#
# COVERAGE IS STATED, NEVER IMPLIED. The enrolled sources are exactly the rows
# of the private inventory file, each with its own coverage sentence and its own
# checkpoint. Enrolling some channels does not enrol a workspace. A source whose
# last read failed reports `unknown`, never "nothing new".
#
# TWO DISCLOSED DETECTION LIMITS, both bounded by design and neither hidden:
#   Edit horizon. An in-place edit keeps the original source id, so a forward
#   cursor never returns it again. Re-detection therefore depends on the
#   orchestrator re-reading a bounded recent window (revision_window_seconds)
#   and re-`observe`ing it; the digest comparison here then updates the same
#   item. AN EDIT OLDER THAN THAT WINDOW IS NOT DETECTED. Widening the window
#   costs a proportional re-read on every tick.
#   Thread replies. A cursor read of a channel returns messages whose own id is
#   newer than the cursor, so a reply added to a thread whose parent predates
#   the cursor can appear in no such read. `observe --thread` records a per
#   parent reply marker and `claim` prints the tracked parents back, so the
#   orchestrator can re-read only the threads whose marker advanced. The tracked
#   set is BOUNDED by revision_window_seconds: a parent whose marker has not
#   advanced within that window leaves it, which is what keeps the claim output
#   and the connector work per tick from growing with all thread history. So
#   coverage is parents still inside that bounded set and NOTHING OLDER. No
#   completeness is claimed. docs/channel-intake.md owns both limits in full.
#
# PER-POLL WORK IS BOUNDED, HISTORY IS NOT DISCARDED. Every ledger surface
# reads a whole record directory in one process rather than one per field per
# record, and routine traffic older than the brief horizon that is the only
# place it is rendered MOVES out of the polled set into `inactive/` with its
# record intact. Nothing is deleted, nothing is auto-resolved: `items` still
# lists it, `status` still counts it, and re-observing the same key restores
# it rather than opening a second item. Anything owed, waiting, corrected or
# already notified stays in the polled set whatever its age.
#
# NO POLL LOOP CAN RUN AWAY. interval_seconds has a hard floor, a failing
# source backs off geometrically to a bounded ceiling instead of retrying
# harder, and `tick` enqueues at most one wake per armed cycle. A throttle
# reported by a connector is a reason to call `fail` and back off, never a
# reason to measure the ceiling by hitting it.
#
# Opt-in is per home and per device: with no `enabled = true` line in private
# config/channel-intake this command is inert, so cloning the repo or seeding
# another home never enrols it.
#
# Configuration lives in private, gitignored config/channel-intake as
# `key = value` lines. Unknown keys are refused rather than ignored, so no
# secret or account path can be parked in this file. Source identities are not
# configuration: they live in the private inventory file below.

# --- watcher check and session-start surface ----------------------------------

# The watcher contract: one line when firstmate should wake, nothing otherwise,
# finishing well inside FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT. Suppression is by signature, so an
# unchanged state wakes the primary once rather than on every poll.
#
# Due sources and notifiable items are two independent conditions and each
# carries its own signature and its own marker. One combined snapshot would
# couple them: a claim that empties the due set while an alert is still held
# reads as a brand-new combined state, so the primary would be woken again
# about the alert it has already been told about, twice per poll interval, for
# as long as the alert stays held - and `capped`, `spaced` and an unverified
# recipient are all standing conditions rather than edge cases.
#
# Each signature carries the term that actually moves under it - the
# last-attempt watermark for due sources, the identity of the notifiable set
# for notifications - and a condition that is currently absent clears its own
# marker. That is what the morning gate gets from folding its monotonic
# `updated` stamp in: without it a recurring identical state is suppressed
# forever and the live wake path fires once in the life of the home.
