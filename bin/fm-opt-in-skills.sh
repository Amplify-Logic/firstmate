#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-opt-in-skills.sh - link the opt-in skills this home switched on into a
# checkout's skill folder, and only those.
#
# WHY. Every skill under .agents/skills/ is listed in every session of every
# home that runs this checkout, so its description costs every session tokens
# and its trigger can fire anywhere. Some skills serve one home's own setup: a
# CLI or subscription the bootstrap never installs, or the owner's own apps,
# accounts and colleagues. A teammate's fresh clone should not load them. So
# those skills live in .agents/opt-in-skills/, which no harness scans, and a
# home switches each one on with a presence flag in its private config/. sync
# then puts a relative symlink .agents/skills/<skill> -> ../opt-in-skills/<skill>
# into the checkout, so a switched-on skill is found at the same path, under the
# same name, as when it was tracked there.
#
# SKILLS AND SWITCHES. docs/configuration.md "Opt-in skills" documents which
# config/ presence flag switches each skill on; skill_table below applies it. A
# switch is a presence flag: any file or link at a skill's path turns it on,
# whatever it holds. Every skill in the table needs a matching
# /.agents/skills/<skill> line in the tracked .gitignore, so a link never makes
# the checkout read as changed.
#
# ADD-ON SKILLS. A home with a private add-on (bin/fm-addon.sh) also gets every
# skill in the add-on's .agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md, linked by absolute path
# as .agents/skills/<skill> -> <add-on>/.agents/skills/<skill>. Their names are
# not known to the tracked .gitignore, so sync adds one /.agents/skills/<skill>
# line per linked skill to the repository's own info/exclude, which keeps the
# checkout reading as clean and is never removed. An add-on skill with the name
# of an opt-in skill replaces it, so a skill that moved into the add-on is
# linked once. With no add-on, or once the add-on drops a skill, sync removes
# the add-on links it finds.
#
# SAFETY. sync only ever creates, or removes, a symlink whose target is exactly
# ../opt-in-skills/<skill>, or an absolute <somewhere>/.agents/skills/<skill>
# other than the link's own path, which is the shape of an add-on link wherever
# the add-on sits, inside the home (projects/starship-personal) or beside it.
# Anything else at that path - a real folder, a file, or a link pointing
# elsewhere - is left as it is and named on stderr. A checkout with no .agents/opt-in-skills/ folder (any
# project other than Firstmate, or a Firstmate copy older than this split) is
# left alone.
#
# WHEN. A harness lists skills once, when it starts (verified for Claude Code
# 2.1.300: a link made by its own SessionStart hook is not listed in that
# session), so a link has to exist before the session it serves:
#   - bin/fm-primary.sh syncs this home's checkout before it starts the CLI;
#   - bin/fm-update.sh syncs it right after the fast-forward, so an update that
#     moves a skill never leaves the running session without it;
#   - bin/fm-spawn.sh syncs a Firstmate task worktree before its worker starts;
#   - session-start bootstrap syncs this home's checkout on every locked
#     startup, so a switch changed by hand takes effect from the next launch.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-opt-in-skills.sh sync [<checkout>]  link or unlink every opt-in and add-on
#                                          skill in <checkout> (default: this
#                                          script's own repository) for this home
# sync prints nothing unless it leaves a path alone, and exits 0 even then, so a
# launch never fails over one skill. It exits 2 on misuse.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests and unusual layouts:
#   FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE, FM_HOME, FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE
