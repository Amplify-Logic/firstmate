#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-speak.sh - speak one captain-facing outcome line out of this machine's
# own speaker, in the captain's spoken register.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-speak.sh [--dry-run] <text>
#   fm-speak.sh --help
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: firstmate could already speak to the captain through the
# glasses loop, which owns the spoken register and enforces it in code. What it
# could not do is speak when he is at the desk without the glasses. This is that
# missing sink and nothing else: the same sentence, shaped by the same owner,
# handed to the local speaker instead of to the phone mailbox.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT:
#   - Not a second owner of the spoken register. The register - outcome first,
#     two or three short sentences, about eight seconds, never a URL, path or
#     id, and never a request for a spoken yes - is owned once by the glasses
#     project's announce entry point. This script shapes through that owner and
#     refuses to speak if it cannot reach it, because speaking unshaped text
#     would read a URL aloud, which is the one thing the register forbids
#     outright.
#   - Not an approval channel. The register owner refuses text that asks the
#     captain to decide, so money, outward and destructive choices structurally
#     cannot be put to him by voice. They stay in the terminal.
#   - Not a listener. Speech in is whatever already types into the composer;
#     this script only speaks out.
#   - Not proof anything was heard. Exit 0 means the shaped line was handed to
#     the speaker, never that audio was produced or that the captain heard it.
#
# OPT-IN: per home and per device, through private gitignored config/speak. With
# no `enabled = true` line this command is inert and silent, so cloning this
# repo, seeding a secondmate home, or adding a device never makes it talk.
# Config is `key = value` lines; unknown keys are refused rather than ignored.
#   enabled   true to arm this home (default false)
#   voice     optional `say` voice name (default: the system voice)
#
# NEVER BLOCKS THE CALLER'S TURN. The register call is bounded and waited on
# because its output is needed; the speaker call is bounded and detached,
# with its standard streams closed, so a caller that captures this script's
# output is never held open by audio that is still playing. A speech error
# downstream of that handoff is unobservable here by design.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests and unusual layouts:
#   FM_SPEAK_SHAPER    register owner exposing the `--dry-run <text>` contract
#                      (default: $FM_HOME/projects/glasses-voice/bin/announce)
#   FM_SPEAK_SAY       speech binary (default: /usr/bin/say)
#   FM_SPEAK_TIMEOUT   bounded seconds for each call (default 60)
#
# EXIT CODES (mirroring the register owner's own contract):
#   0  handed to the speaker, printed under --dry-run, or this home is not
#      opted in
#   1  cannot speak: the register owner is unreachable or failed, the speech
#      binary is missing, or the config is invalid
#   2  refused by the register; nothing was spoken and the reason is reported
