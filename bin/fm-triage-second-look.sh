# fm-triage-second-look.sh - an opt-in second look over the status lines the
# deterministic wake classifier has already dropped.
#
# Firstmate's shipped classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh) decides what is
# captain-relevant from a status line's leading verb. That is deliberately
# verb-aware and correctly refuses to be fooled by prose, but a verb test cannot
# read a sentence: a worker that writes
#   working: the backfill migration truncated public.users on staging; 4100 rows gone
# is dropped permanently by every caller, and nobody ever learns the table is
# gone. This command closes exactly that gap and nothing else.
#
# ESCALATE-ONLY, and that is the property that makes a paid, networked, semantic
# judgment safe inside a supervision loop. It is only ever handed lines the
# classifier ALREADY dropped, and the only thing it can emit is a promotion.
# There is no output that silences a line, so neither a model answer nor text a
# worker writes into a status line can suppress an escalation Firstmate would
# otherwise make. The worst a hostile status line can achieve is one extra line
# in a digest.
#
# FAIL-OPEN. Not opted in, no key, no python3, a timeout, a rate limit, a
# malformed body - every one of them prints nothing and exits nonzero, and
# supervision behaves exactly as it does today. "The second look is down" and
# "the second look was never built" are the same state, so callers run it with
# `|| true`, read promotions from its stdout, and send its stderr to their own log.
#
# NEVER ON THE PER-WAKE PATH. The two callers are the heartbeat backstops
# (bin/fm-watch.sh and bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh), which run on the heartbeat
# cadence. The per-wake watcher path must stay cheap and work offline.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-triage-second-look.sh                 read records on stdin, print promotions
#   fm-triage-second-look.sh --dry-run       build and print the request; no network
#   fm-triage-second-look.sh --help
#
# stdin   one record per line: <task-id> TAB <status-line>
#         Callers produce these from status_span_dropped_lines (fm-classify-lib.sh).
# stdout  one promotion per line: <task-id> TAB <tier> TAB <reason> TAB <status-line>
#         <tier> is alert or digest. <tier> alert means the supervisor should be
#         interrupted; digest means it joins the next batch. <reason> is the
#         +-joined conditions that fired: needs_captain, adverse_event,
#         understated_terminal. Callers carry the reason into the digest so the
#         supervisor reads WHY a line was raised.
# stderr  diagnostics only; never the API key, never a line's content.
#
# Exit 0 when a decision was reached, including "promote nothing". Exit 1 when
# this home is not armed. Exit 2 on any bounded failure. Every nonzero exit means
# the same thing to a caller: promote nothing.
#
# OPT-IN: per home and per device, through the private gitignored
# config/triage-second-look. With no `enabled = true` line this command is inert
# and makes no network call at all, so cloning this repository, seeding a
# secondmate home, or adding a device never starts making paid calls. The gate is
# deliberately NOT inherited into secondmate homes for the same reason.
# Configuration is `key = value` lines; the only key is `enabled`. Unlike
# config/speak, a malformed gate file reports and leaves this home INERT rather
# than exiting loudly, because the caller is a supervision loop and a config typo
# must never change what that loop does.
#
# Cost: ~516 input tokens per dropped line at $42/Btok. A heartbeat scan carrying
# five new dropped lines is about $0.0001, and a busy home all day is under $1 a
# month. Most scans carry zero or one line.
#
# Env:
#   FM_HOME                                 operational home (default: this repo root)
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_TIMEOUT           per-request bound in seconds (default 8)
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_BOUND             hard bound on the whole call (default 20)
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_MAX_LINES         lines per batch (default 25)
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_ENDPOINT          API endpoint
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_ENV_FILE          .env holding TYPESAFE_API_KEY
#   FM_TRIAGE_SECOND_LOOK_RESPONSE          test seam: a recorded response body,
#                                           used instead of the network so the real
#                                           request build and threshold rule still run
#   TYPESAFE_API_KEY                        wins over the .env; never logged
#
# The request shape, the four questions, the thresholds and the tier rule are
# owned by the engine, bin/fm-triage-second-look.py. docs/configuration.md
# "Status second look" owns the operator-facing contract.
