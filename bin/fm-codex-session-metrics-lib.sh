# Supply the Codex/Astra companion row with real context and provider-quota
# metrics for the EXACT primary session the companion is following.
#
# Sourced by bin/fm-status-bar.sh. The field, threshold, placeholder, and
# provenance contract lives in docs/status-bar.md; this file owns the mechanics.
#
# Public entry point:
#   fm_codex_session_metrics <pane> <backend> <herdr-session> <state-dir>
#     -> "<context-used>\t<quota-used>\t<quota-window>"
#
# Every field is "--" when it cannot be established truthfully. A missing,
# malformed, stale, expired, or unattributable reading is always "--", never 0.
#
# Two metrics, two DIFFERENT owners, deliberately not interchangeable.
#
# Context is this thread's own occupancy of the model context window, so it must
# come from the exact session the companion follows. The followed pane resolves
# to its foreground Codex process - positively identified as such on both
# backends - that process is asked which rollout file it currently holds OPEN,
# and only that file is read. Codex holds exactly one rollout open per thread,
# so the open descriptor is the process's own statement of which thread it is
# running. Nothing here picks the newest file in the sessions tree: a sibling
# Codex session - another primary, a worker, the desktop app - owns a different
# descriptor and can never be borrowed. No Codex process behind the pane, no
# rollout, or MORE than one rollout is a refusal.
#
# Provider quota is an ACCOUNT-level allowance and is not this thread's
# consumption, so it is never derived from thread totals. It comes from
# quota-axi, which already owns provider and account resolution, read strictly
# read-only. quota-axi is the ONLY quota source here. The row reports the
# account's own binding window with that window named, so the figure can never
# imply a scope it does not have.
#
# The rollout's own rate_limits block is a THIRD thing, and it is NOT a quota
# source. It is stamped with a limit identity - limit_id and limit_name - which
# is frequently NOT the running model's: a live gpt-6-astra primary was measured
# carrying limit_id=codex_bengalfox (GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark) at 0% used while the
# account's actual binding weekly window sat at 54% used. Reporting that 0% as
# the primary's quota reads as "plenty of headroom" when there is none. No
# identity rule recovers the block's true scope either, because the block never
# states which account or which model allowance it describes, and a name-shaped
# guess mismatches exactly where it matters: the plain `codex` profile's model
# string is a substring of `codex_bengalfox`. So the block is not read for quota
# at all, under any name. The rollout supplies context, and nothing else.
#
# Only metric metadata is read: the last token-count event's token totals and
# context window. Conversation content in the rollout is never parsed, printed,
# or cached.
#
# Cost control: the pane/process/descriptor resolution and rollout read are
# cached for FM_CODEX_METRICS_TTL seconds (default 15), and the rollout is read
# through a bounded escalating tail rather than a whole-file scan, because a
# live rollout reaches hundreds of megabytes. The quota-axi read is a
# subprocess, so a refresh NEVER waits on it: a cache miss starts one detached
# read whose answer a later refresh picks up, under its own longer
# FM_CODEX_QUOTA_TTL (default 120) and an in-flight lock. A one-second companion
# refresh therefore performs no blocking subprocess work on any tick. No
# credential is read, no credential refresh is delegated, and no token value is
# ever printed.
#
# Test seams:
#   FM_CODEX_METRICS_ROLLOUT     use this rollout path instead of resolving one
#   FM_CODEX_METRICS_TTL         rollout cache lifetime in seconds
#   FM_CODEX_METRICS_TAIL_BYTES  first rollout tail step in bytes
#   FM_CODEX_CONTEXT_MAX_AGE     how long a last-known context sample survives
#   FM_CODEX_QUOTA_TTL           provider-quota cache lifetime in seconds
#   FM_CODEX_QUOTA_JSON          read provider quota from this file, not quota-axi
#   FM_CODEX_QUOTA_DISABLE       set to 1 to skip the provider-quota source
#   FM_CODEX_QUOTA_WAIT          bound on the detached provider read, seconds
#   FM_CODEX_QUOTA_WARM_TTL      how long one detached read is considered in flight
#   FM_CODEX_METRICS_NOW         override the current epoch
#   FM_CODEX_METRICS_NO_CACHE    set to 1 to bypass both caches

# The cache, freshness, and single-refresh mechanics are shared with the other
# status supply in bin/fm-status-cache-lib.sh, so both agree on what "still true
# enough to show" means. The POLICY - the TTLs above and the no-cache seam -
