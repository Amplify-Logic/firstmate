# Add the fork's bridge fields to a finished bearings model.
#
# Usage: fm-bridge-fields.sh <fleet-snapshot-json-file> < model.json > enriched.json
#
# The phone bridge renders fields upstream's projection does not emit: a human
# title, an owner, a repo, and the hold kind and reason behind a decision or a
# gate. Those used to be edits scattered through upstream's jq program, which is
# the shape that conflicts on every upstream change to it. They live here
# instead, and bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh calls this in one guarded step.
#
# This reads the same fleet snapshot the projection read, so every value is
# derived from the same source rather than recovered from the rendered model.
# Rows are matched by id, including the "<home>/<id>" form a secondmate row
# carries. A row this cannot match keeps whatever the projection gave it.
#
# Adds fields only. With this script absent the model is upstream's exact
# projection, which is what the bridge must degrade against.
#
# A secondmate home's decisions_open and queued are looked up in separate maps,
# never merged: an actionable captain hold appears in both under one id, and
# the decision row must read its reason from decisions_open while the gate row
# reads hold_reason from queued, exactly as the projection did in its own loop
# over each collection.
#
# Key order is deliberately not part of the guarantee. The fork fields are
# appended after upstream's keys, and equivalence with the pre-extraction
# projection is proven on sorted keys.
