# Captain-facing state vocabulary for Herdr presentation surfaces.
#
# Source this library; it defines functions and runs nothing.
#
#   fm_visible_state <canonical-state>   -> NEEDS LARS|FAILED|BLOCKED|WORKING|WAITING|READY
#   fm_visible_icon <visible-state>      -> the state's colour dot
#   fm_visible_aggregate <stats>         -> "🟣 1 NEEDS LARS · 🔵 2 WORKING"
#
# <stats> is the six space-separated counts
# "<needs> <failed> <blocked> <working> <waiting> <ready>", already in urgency
# order, and fm_visible_aggregate's own loop is the single owner of that order:
# it emits only non-zero groups, most urgent first, or "no tasks" when every
# count is zero.
#
# This is the single owner of that vocabulary.
# bin/fm-visible-status.sh renders the live fleet with it, and
# bin/fm-herdr-preview-lib.sh renders the unapproved layout preview with it, so
# the two surfaces can never drift apart on what a state is called or coloured.
# Canonical state itself comes only from bin/fm-crew-state.sh; nothing here
# reads or infers it.
