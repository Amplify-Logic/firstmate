# fm-deck.sh - the captain's private ACTION DECK pane.
#
# One refreshing, read-only terminal view that answers "what is waiting for me"
# above the fold and then shows what is moving. It is captain-private: it renders
# only from records this home already keeps and holds no queue, no cache, and no
# state of its own beyond the frame it is currently drawing.
#
# Sections, most-actionable first:
#   STAGED FOR YOUR CLICK  bin/fm-tray.sh json, grouped by standing order using
#                          bin/fm-order.sh list --no-tray-depth (age headline,
#                          expiry countdown)
#   NEEDS YOU              parked and blocked work, pull requests that are ready
#                          to review with their full URL, and durable captain
#                          decisions; one row per worker, and a failed worker's
#                          pull request is not ready to review
#   LOOSE ENDS             data/loose-ends/latest.md, the manual inbox sweep
#   UNDER WAY              one outcome line per recorded worker
#   JUST IN                recent completions and findings
#
# Herdr workspace registration: firstmate opens this pane as its own tab in the
# captain's "Aquablu Starship" workspace with
#   herdr tab create --workspace <id> --label 'Action Deck' --command 'bin/fm-deck.sh'
# where <id> is that workspace's recorded id. This script never drives Herdr
# itself; the screen doctrine owns tab layout.
#
# Every section degrades to an honest empty line rather than an error when its
# source is missing or empty, because a pane that errors out is a pane the
# captain stops trusting.
#
# State vocabulary and colours come from bin/fm-visible-format-lib.sh, the one
# owner of that captain-facing wording. The UNDER WAY state is a projection of
# the durable status stream folded by bin/fm-classify-lib.sh, labelled REPORTED
# because that is what it is: bin/fm-crew-state.sh remains the owner of live
# current state, and the deck deliberately does not call it so a refresh stays
# well under a second.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-deck.sh [--interval <secs>]   refresh until interrupted (default 15)
#   fm-deck.sh --once                print one snapshot and exit
#   fm-deck.sh -h|--help
#
# Environment:
#   FM_HOME / FM_DATA_OVERRIDE / FM_STATE_OVERRIDE / FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE
#                          home and root directories
#   FM_DECK_COLUMNS        render width; else COLUMNS, else the terminal's own
#                          window size, else tput cols, else 100
#   FM_DECK_NOW            override unix epoch for ages and the clock (tests)
#   FM_DECK_JUST_IN        completions to show in JUST IN (default 5)
#   FM_DECK_LOOSE_ENDS     urgent/waiting loose ends to show (default 5)
#   FM_DECK_NEEDS_YOU      rows to show in NEEDS YOU before "+n more" (default 8)
#   FM_DECK_MAX_FRAMES     stop after this many refreshes; test seam so the
#                          suite can assert the loop's redraw without killing a
#                          process. Unset means refresh until interrupted.
#
# Exit:
#   0 on success, or on any single source being absent or unreadable
#   1 on usage error or a missing python3
