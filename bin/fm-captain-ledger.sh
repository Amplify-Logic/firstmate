#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-captain-ledger.sh - the captain ledger: every prompt the captain submits to
# the primary, written to disk before the model answers, so a decision given in
# chat survives a session that never runs /stow, a compaction, or a crash.
#
# WHY. A decision the captain gives in chat used to live only in conversation
# until an agent chose to write it down. Stow memory, the captain-hold
# lifecycle, and RECORD DIVERGENCE all act on what an agent already recorded,
# so a turn that said "all logged" without logging lost the words for good.
# The ledger takes that step away from the model: a code-owned hook records the
# words, and the session-start digest keeps listing them until an agent says it
# has reconciled them.
#
# This script never interprets the words. It captures and counts; the agent
# reconciles each entry against data/captain.md, the backlog, and the decision
# files (or runs /stow), then marks the ledger reconciled.
#
# WRITER. `hook claude` runs as the tracked Claude UserPromptSubmit hook in
# .claude/settings.json. It appends the submitted prompt, with only the
# whitespace at its very end trimmed, and records nothing for:
#   - input bin/fm-operational-input.sh classifies as operational (watcher
#     wakes, turn-end guard follow-ups, away-supervisor escalations, launch
#     briefs, from-firstmate steers, and their pre-protocol forms);
#   - a prompt that opens with <task-notification>, the wrapper Claude puts
#     around a turn it started itself, such as a Stop-hook rewake;
#   - a payload Cursor delivered through the same settings file
#     (bin/fm-hook-host-lib.sh), any event other than UserPromptSubmit, and an
#     empty prompt;
#   - any session outside a genuine primary root (a plain firstmate checkout or
#     a marked secondmate home, never a linked crew or scout worktree, and never
#     a task worker pane) or one that does not hold this home's session lock
#     (bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh), so crewmates and read-only second sessions
#     record nothing.
# It always exits 0, prints nothing, and writes nothing to stderr, so it can
# neither block nor delay a prompt.
#
# FILE. data/captain-ledger.jsonl, append-only, created owner-only (mode 600)
# and kept inside gitignored data/. One JSON object per line:
#   {"seq":N,"epoch":N,"session":"<harness session id>","text":"..."}
# seq rises by one per entry and stays above the cursor even if the ledger is
# removed. text is capped at 4000 characters, its truncation note included,
# keeping the head and the tail. The ledger is never trimmed.
#
# CURSOR. state/.captain-ledger-cursor holds the seq of the newest entry marked
# reconciled. `pending` lists the entries above it: a heading with their count
# and the date of the oldest, previews of the newest 12 (each at most 160
# characters, whitespace collapsed), the ledger path, and the one instruction to
# reconcile and mark. It prints nothing when nothing is pending, and a heading
# naming the ledger when the ledger exists but cannot be read.
# bin/fm-session-start.sh prints that output as a digest section on both its
# full and --reemit paths, so it reappears at every startup, /clear, and
# compaction until `mark` moves the cursor to the newest entry.
# The ledger holds the captain's raw words, so nothing but `pending` (and through
# it the digest) ever prints them.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-captain-ledger.sh hook claude   a UserPromptSubmit payload on stdin
#   fm-captain-ledger.sh pending       list entries not yet marked reconciled
#   fm-captain-ledger.sh mark          mark every entry so far reconciled
# hook always exits 0 silently; pending and mark exit 0, and 2 on misuse.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests and unusual layouts:
#   FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE, FM_HOME, FM_STATE_OVERRIDE, FM_DATA_OVERRIDE
