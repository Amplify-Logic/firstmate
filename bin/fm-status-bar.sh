#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Render the canonical Firstmate primary status bar.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-status-bar.sh --adapter claude
#   fm-status-bar.sh --adapter pi --model MODEL --effort LEVEL \
#     --context-used PERCENT --quota-used PERCENT --cost USD
#   fm-status-bar.sh --adapter kimi --model MODEL --effort LEVEL \
#     --follow-pane PANE [--follow-backend tmux|herdr]
#
# Claude mode reads the native statusLine JSON payload from stdin.
# Cursor mode reads Cursor CLI's native statusLine JSON payload from stdin.
# Pi supplies its native footer metrics as normalized arguments.
# Kimi and Codex use --follow-pane for a companion row because neither exposes
# a third-party status-bar API that can carry Firstmate's fleet fields.
# --follow-backend selects the session provider that owns the companion pane:
# tmux (default) or herdr. Herdr panes are addressed by HERDR_PANE_ID.
#
# The Codex companion supplies its own context and quota figures rather than
# leaving them blank: bin/fm-codex-session-metrics-lib.sh binds to the exact
# primary session behind the followed pane and resolves the account's binding
# quota window. Kimi keeps "--" for both, because no equivalent source has been
# verified for it. That library owns the mechanics, the separation that keeps an
# account-level allowance and a per-session reading from standing in for each
# other, and the caching that keeps a one-second refresh off the provider.
#
# --chrome-pane turns on Herdr chrome mode, which is what reclaims the
# companion's empty rows. The canonical row is ALSO published to the primary
# pane's own border title, where it costs no rows at all, so the companion pane
# can be hidden by zoom while the status stays visible. The in-pane row keeps
# being drawn either way: it is the fallback the captain sees the moment the
# primary is unzoomed, and it means a chrome failure degrades to exactly the
# behavior that shipped before chrome mode existed.
# --chrome-role prefixes that border row with the launcher's compact visible
# role marker (FM, or LAB for a lab primary), so the guarded primary identity
# survives on the border rather than being displaced by the status fields.
# Chrome mode never zooms: bin/fm-primary.sh zooms once at launch, and this
# renderer only ever RELEASES the zoom, when a third pane appears in the tab.
# A deliberate unzoom by the captain is therefore never fought.
# --chrome-zoomed is how the launcher says it ACTUALLY applied that zoom. It is
# the only thing that arms the release watch, so this renderer can never issue
# `pane zoom --off` against a zoom it does not own - the launcher withholds the
# zoom on a crowded tab while still passing --chrome-pane, and without this
# signal the renderer would release a co-tenant's zoom it never applied.
#
# --role renders a compact account role beside the model. It is only ever a
# verified label supplied by the launcher: --role, else FM_PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_ROLE
# (which bin/fm-primary.sh sets for its companion panes), else the account
# owner's own FM_ACCOUNT_NAME, which is what reaches the native Claude, Pi and
# Cursor surfaces. This renderer only CONSUMES that resolution; bin/fm-account-*
# owns it. An unknown account renders no label at all rather than a guess, and
# an ID or email is never rendered.
#
# The complete field, threshold, color, placeholder, and adapter contract lives
# in docs/status-bar.md.
# This renderer is inert unless FM_PRIMARY_HARNESS matches --adapter, so tracked
# project integrations never activate outside bin/fm-primary.sh.
#
# Test seam:
#   FM_STATUS_BAR_NOW overrides the current epoch.

# Herdr's border title is stored, and silently clipped, at 80 CODEPOINTS, with
# no marker of its own (measured on herdr 0.7.4). Herdr's renderer does truncate
# visibly for a narrow pane - it appends its own ellipsis - so width is Herdr's
# problem, but the 80-codepoint store is ours: a row that arrives longer than
# that loses its rightmost fields with nothing to show it happened.
#
# So whole fields are dropped from the right until the row fits, and a visible
# marker is appended. Clipping on the field separator is deliberate: the row is
# full of multibyte glyphs, and slicing it by offset could split one, whereas a
# separator is located by pattern and always falls on a character boundary. Only
# the final fallback trims, and it trims whole codepoints, never bytes.
#
# The measurement cannot rely on the ambient locale. `${#var}` counts CODEPOINTS
# under a UTF-8 LC_CTYPE and BYTES under C/POSIX, and neither the herdr server
# nor the shell it spawns the companion in is guaranteed to carry a UTF-8
# locale. The row is emoji-heavy, so a byte count runs roughly half again as
# long as the codepoint count and would drop whole fields off a row that fits.
# So the locale is forced to C and the codepoints are counted directly: every
