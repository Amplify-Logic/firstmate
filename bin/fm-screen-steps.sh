# Show the captain an always-on-top card of on-screen steps over a page they
# must fill in themselves, such as a form in a web console.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-screen-steps.sh show [--url <http(s)-url>] --steps-file <file>
#   fm-screen-steps.sh hide
#   fm-screen-steps.sh reply done|stuck [--step <n>]
#   fm-screen-steps.sh --help
#
# show opens <url> as a new tab in Arc's main browser window (never a
# Little Arc popup) and brings that window to the front, so the page shows at
# the full size the captain keeps that window; Arc makes a new window when it
# has none. An existing Arc window is never moved or resized. Without Arc, or
# when Arc refuses, the URL opens in the default browser. Then the card shows
# above the page: the title, any note, the numbered steps, and every value to
# type with its own Copy button, plus Done and Stuck buttons. Without --url
# the card is shown over whatever is already on screen. Only http and https
# URLs are opened. A second show replaces the card's contents (and clears its
# ticks); hide closes it. One line per action on stdout:
#   opened: arc <url>                     opened in Arc
#   opened: default-browser <url>         Arc is missing or refused (the
#                                         reason goes to stderr)
#   card: <card.json path>                the card shows these steps
#
# The steps file is simple Markdown:
#   # Create the app in App Store Connect     <- title (first "# " line)
#   Open My Apps first.                       <- note: lines before step 1
#   1. Click + and choose New App.            <- a step: "1." "1)" "-" "*"
#   2. Platform: tick `iOS`.                  <- `code` is a value to copy
#   3. Name: `Happiness Compass`
#      Keep the capital letters.              <- other lines join the step
# Every `code` span in a step becomes a value with a Copy button; the step
# text shows it in monospace, and any **bold** too. Blank lines are ignored.
# A file with no step is refused.
#
# The card is the native panel in screen-steps/, built on first use (and
# after any change to its sources) into screen-steps/.build/ScreenSteps.app
# with the linker's ad-hoc signature; it needs no macOS permission. It floats
# above every app and Space, never takes keyboard focus from the page (Copy
# writes the clipboard; clicking the card leaves the cursor in the form), can
# be dragged anywhere by its background, sits in the bottom-right corner, and
# its X button runs hide. The card reads
#   $FM_HOME/state/screen-steps/card.json
# which show writes and hide removes; the card closes itself once that file
# is gone. One card runs per home; its pid is kept in card.pid there.
#
# Done and Stuck run reply, which sends one short line of the captain's own
# into the primary Firstmate chat through the desk floater's delivery path,
# bin/fm-desk-voice.sh send --source screen-steps (typed into the chat, or
# saved to its mailbox when the chat cannot take it; docs/desk-floater.md),
# and prints that script's outcome line. Done also closes the card once the
# line is on its way. A step the captain ticks on the card marks it done;
# Stuck names the first step not ticked when any is ticked:
#   Done with the on-screen steps: <title>
#   Stuck on the on-screen steps: <title>
#   Stuck at step <n> of the on-screen steps: <title> (<step text>)
#
# Arc: osascript tells Arc to open the tab, which needs the Automation
# permission for Arc from the app running this script; macOS asks once. Every
# osascript call is bounded by FM_SCREEN_STEPS_ARC_TIMEOUT seconds (default
# 20), so a permission dialog nobody answers never hangs show.
#
# Automated runs never reach the captain's screen or chat: under CI,
# GITHUB_ACTIONS or a no-mistakes gate (NO_MISTAKES_GATE, or this script
# running from a no-mistakes worktree), show and reply refuse before opening
# a page, starting the card or sending anything, unless
# FM_SCREEN_STEPS_LIVE=1 is set by hand. No CI job or pipeline sets it; the
# tests drive show and reply only through stand-ins with those variables
# cleared.
#
# Environment: FM_HOME selects the home (default: this code root);
# FM_STATE_OVERRIDE its state directory.
#
# Exit: 0 ok, 1 failure, 2 bad usage, 3 refused in an automated run.
