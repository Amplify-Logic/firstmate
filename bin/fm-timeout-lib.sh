# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared portable wall-clock timeout for bounded read-only probes.
# Usage: . bin/fm-timeout-lib.sh
#
# fm_run_timeout <secs> <cmd...> runs <cmd...> under a <secs> wall-clock bound,
# passing its stdout and stderr straight through. Exit status is the command's,
# or 124 on timeout (the GNU timeout convention).
#
# STDIN IS ALWAYS /dev/null, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness.
# Every bound below runs the command in its own process group so a timeout can
# kill the whole group, which also moves that command out of the terminal's
# foreground process group.
# A probed CLI that touches the terminal on stdin then takes SIGTTIN or SIGTTOU
# and stops until the bound kills it, so the caller reads an EMPTY answer from a
# perfectly healthy tool - but only when a terminal is attached, which is why
# every non-interactive caller and test saw the probe pass.
# That is what refused `firstmate claude` at its account seat check: the seat
# proof read nothing and the launcher concluded it could not prove the seat.
# Detaching stdin removes the terminal from the child entirely and keeps the
# group-kill semantics that bound runaway children.
# Every caller here is a read-only probe, so none of them has stdin to pass
# through; bin/fm-toolchain-lib.sh already added this redirect at its own call
# site before the helper owned it.
#
# Portability: prefers timeout(1), then gtimeout(1), then a perl fallback that
# runs the child in its own process group and kills the group on alarm, so a
# stock macOS box with neither coreutils binary is still bounded.
#
# This is the one owner of that helper. Callers that need a bounded probe source
# this file rather than open-coding a second background-wait loop.
