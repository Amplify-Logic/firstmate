# Install and inspect the local morning-intake schedule on macOS launchd.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-morning-intake-schedule.sh render
#   fm-morning-intake-schedule.sh install
#   fm-morning-intake-schedule.sh status
#   fm-morning-intake-schedule.sh remove
#   fm-morning-intake-schedule.sh --help
#
# The schedule is intentionally visible, not an opaque cron entry.
# `render` prints the complete plist, `status` prints its path, the resolved
# knobs and the installed definition, and `install` writes
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<label>.plist, loads it, and arms the watcher check.
#
# `StartInterval` plus `RunAtLoad` is the whole trigger. launchd runs the job on
# login and then on the interval, and a job whose interval elapsed while the
# machine was asleep runs shortly after it wakes. That is the catch-up path, and
# it is why the intake is described as the FIRST AVAILABLE MORNING rather than a
# lid-open event: launchd exposes no such event here and none is claimed.
#
# The gate itself lives in bin/fm-morning-intake.sh, which owns the local day,
# the threshold, deduplication, retries and the completion watermark. This
# script only decides WHEN that gate is consulted, and reads the cadence back
# from the gate owner rather than parsing config a second time. The LaunchAgent
# itself is written by the shared owner in bin/fm-launchd-schedule-lib.sh.
#
# The label is derived from FM_HOME, so each operational home installs its own
# agent and installing here never disturbs another home's schedule.
