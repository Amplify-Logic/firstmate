# fm-gateway-install-v2.sh - installation lifecycle for the action gateway v2.
#
# This script produces the artifacts a privileged installation needs and shows
# exactly what that installation would do. It never performs one, and it never
# performs an uninstall. `apply` is present and always refuses, because creating
# the service principals, writing the root-owned state ancestors, loading the
# launch definitions, and enrolling the approver key are the captain's own step
# at the Mac, not something an agent does on his behalf.
#
# That refusal is the point of the script rather than a limitation of it. Until
# those commands run under the captain's hands, the gateway's own evidence
# boundary says plainly that distinct installed principals, root-owned
# ancestors, Secure Enclave enrollment, signed UI identity, root launch
# definitions, and network isolation are unproven - and no artifact emitted here
# changes that.
#
# Two rules govern every path this script names or emits:
#
#   Fixed and validated   Every privileged path is a literal constant, checked at
#                         startup for being absolute, normalized, and deep enough
#                         that a truncated or emptied constant can never resolve
#                         to /, /var, /usr, or any other shared ancestor.
#   Never recursive       Uninstall does not delete directories. It moves them to
#                         a timestamped quarantine directory after checking that
#                         the target is not a symlink, is contained in its
#                         expected parent, and is owned by the account that
#                         installed it. Deleting the quarantine afterwards is a
#                         separate decision a person makes with the evidence in
#                         front of them.
#
# Commands:
#   preview            Print the complete activation plan: principals, paths,
#                      owners, modes, launch definitions, and the exact
#                      privileged commands, in the order they must run.
#   check              Report what is actually installed right now, honestly.

#                      not. Reads only; changes nothing.

Action gateway v2 activation preview
====================================

NOTHING BELOW HAS BEEN DONE. This is what installation would do, printed so it
can be reviewed before anyone runs it.

Principals
  broker    $BROKER_USER   owns $STATE_ROOT, serves the three sockets
  executor  $EXECUTOR_USER  the execution socket's peer: it holds one per-job
            execution capability, runs the bound immutable executor code, owns
            $SINK_ROOT, and cannot read the broker root at all
  The separation is the security property. One account for both would make the
  executor able to read every capability hash and every approval in the database,
  which is exactly what the execution socket exists to avoid.
  An ordinary worker is neither of these accounts. Anything that calls prepare
  never receives the executor identity and never receives write access to the
  receipt store, so a worker cannot author the evidence its own action is
  settled from.

Receipt store, and why the broker only reads it
  $SINK_ROOT is $EXECUTOR_USER:$BROKER_GROUP 0750, and the files in it are 0640.
  The broker's entire access is group read; it has no write path to that store
  anywhere in its code, which is what makes a receipt evidence rather than
  something the broker could have authored. The store is journal_mode=TRUNCATE
  for the same reason: a WAL reader has to create the -shm wal-index beside the
  database, and a reader with no write access to that directory is refused
  outright.

Programs, with the bytes that would be installed
  $BROKER_PROGRAM          $(program_digest "$BROKER_PROGRAM")
  $SINK_PROGRAM        $(program_digest "$SINK_PROGRAM")
  $EXECUTOR_PROGRAM           $(program_digest "$EXECUTOR_PROGRAM")
  $IMPORTER_PROGRAM  $(program_digest "$IMPORTER_PROGRAM")
  The safe sink's digest is bound into every resolved plan. Replacing that file
  after an approval invalidates the approval instead of silently running the new
  bytes under the old consent.

Paths, owners, modes
  $INSTALL_ROOT   root:wheel 0755
  $STATE_ROOT      $BROKER_USER:wheel 0700
  $SINK_ROOT         $EXECUTOR_USER:$BROKER_GROUP 0750, each file 0640
  $SOCKET_ROOT     $BROKER_USER:wheel 0755, each socket 0600
  $BROKER_PLIST   root:wheel 0644

Install commands, in order
$(emit_install_script)

Uninstall
  Run the rollback-preview command for the guarded uninstall script. It quarantines by
  moving directories under a timestamp and never deletes a tree, so it cannot
  destroy the audit record or take a neighbouring path with it.

What is still unproven after all of that
  Installing these definitions does not by itself prove distinct principals,
  root-owned ancestors, Secure Enclave enrollment, signed UI identity, or network
  isolation. Those are measured by bin/fm-worker-boundary-regression.sh against a
  real installation, and until that pack runs green on the installed paths, the
  honest statement is that they are planned and unverified.

Outward execution after installation
  Still none. The only executor this gateway will claim for is the deterministic
  safe sink, which appends one local record. An outward executor is a separate
  authorized change, not a consequence of installing this.
