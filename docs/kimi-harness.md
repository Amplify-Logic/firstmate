# Kimi Code harness verification

Empirical verification record for Kimi Code as a Firstmate harness.
Primary support is certified separately through `bin/fm-primary.sh kimi-k3`.
This document owns the WORKER certification record and the dated re-verification of primary hook mechanics on builds newer than that certification.

The distilled operating facts live in the `harness-adapters` skill.
Exact primary launch flags live in `bin/fm-primary.sh`.
Worker dispatch through `bin/fm-spawn.sh` accepts `kimi` after the 2026-07-23 lab.

**Worker lab: 2026-07-23** on:

| Component | Version / note |
|---|---|
| Kimi Code CLI (`kimi`) | `0.27.0` (isolated install under `/tmp/kimi-code-0.27.0-lab`; captain PATH had auto-upgraded to 0.29.0 mid-session and was not used for the cert captures) |
| Model | `kimi-code/k3` (TUI shows `Model: K3`) |
| Isolation | Named non-`default` Herdr lab via `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` |
| Lab session | `fm-lab-firstmate-kimi-w-38519-28030` |

A prior partial lab on 2026-07-21 verified launch/autonomy, trust, composer, exit, and resume, but could not capture busy/interrupt/turn-end because every model call returned billing-cycle `403`.
That quota blocker is gone (Allegretto plan; probe `kimi --prompt 'Reply with exactly OK.' --model kimi-code/k3` succeeded 2026-07-23).

## Scope: primary certified; worker certified 2026-07-23

Kimi primary support (session-start, PreToolUse seatbelt, Stop turn-end guard, watcher protocol) was certified on 2026-07-19 against 0.27.0.
See `docs/architecture.md` and the four lifecycle guard docs for that evidence.
Its primary hook mechanics were re-verified live on 0.31.1 on 2026-08-04; see [Primary hook mechanics on 0.31.1](#primary-hook-mechanics-on-0311-2026-08-04) below.

## Primary hook mechanics on 0.31.1 (2026-08-04)

Re-verified because the certified 0.27.0 build no longer exists on the captain's machine, which took the exact-match launch gate in `bin/fm-primary.sh` down with it.
`bin/fm-primary.sh` no longer blocks on version equality.
It accepts two evidenced builds quietly, the certified 0.27.0 in `KIMI_CERTIFIED_VERSION` and this build in `KIMI_VALIDATED_VERSION`, identifying each in one short line at launch.
Only a build carrying neither kind of primary evidence warns, and even that one launches; `kimi doctor` against the managed home is the functional gate that can still fail a launch closed.

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| Kimi Code CLI (`kimi`) | `0.31.1` (`~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi-0.31.1`, sha256 `8f2403ed...c454fc`) |
| Model | `kimi-code/k3` (TUI showed `Model: K3`, `Version: 0.31.1`, footer `yolo`) |
| Isolation | Scratch `FM_HOME`, scratch Kimi source home, scratch managed home; the captain's `~/.kimi-code` was read through symlinks and never written |
| Managed home | Built by `bin/fm-primary.sh`'s own `prepare_kimi_home` via `FM_KIMI_SOURCE_HOME` and `FM_KIMI_PRIMARY_HOME` |

`kimi doctor` against the managed home passed: `All checked config files are valid.`

Three mechanisms were exercised live, with the plugin's hook commands swapped for logging stubs so the probe never ran Firstmate's real guards.

| Mechanism | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| sessionStart skill injection | PASS | The model reported `There's a system-reminder saying my first output this session must be exactly the token SESSIONSTART_SKILL_LOADED` and emitted that token instead of answering the user's prompt, so the managed plugin's `sessionStart.skill` still reaches model context. |
| PreToolUse (Bash) | PASS | `PRETOOL_FIRED 17:17:59` logged when the model ran `echo probe-ok`, and the command was permitted. |
| Stop turn-end | PASS | `STOP_FIRED` logged at `17:16:48` and `17:18:02`, once per completed turn. |

The plugin manifest schema `bin/fm-primary.sh` writes (`sessionStart.skill` plus a `hooks` array) is still accepted unchanged on 0.31.1.

One lab trap worth recording: `plugins/installed.json` stores an absolute `root`, so copying a managed home to a new path silently keeps loading the plugin from the original path.
Rewrite that field when relocating a managed home, or the probe measures the wrong tree.

Worker (crewmate/scout) certification is complete for the surfaces below on Kimi Code 0.27.0.

## Worker surfaces verified live

### Launch and autonomy (2026-07-21, reconfirmed 2026-07-23)

Interactive launch shape:

```sh
kimi --yolo --model kimi-code/k3
```

Observed TUI chrome: `Version: 0.27.0`, `Model: K3`, footer token `yolo`.
The CLI rejects combining `--prompt` with `--yolo` (`Cannot combine --prompt with --yolo`).
There is no positional interactive prompt for a brief.
`fm-spawn` therefore launches the TUI first, then delivers `brief.md` via the backend send path.
Because that delivery is typed into the pane, `fm-spawn` first requires positive proof that the agent owns it, and refuses rather than typing the brief into a pane that is still a bare shell.
The `FM_KIMI_BRIEF_SETTLE_SECS` settle (default 2) still follows that proof, because a live process is not yet a TUI ready to accept input.

### Trust dialog (2026-07-21)

A brand-new git worktree showed no trust dialog.
The idle composer appeared immediately after launch.

### Composer classification (2026-07-21, reconfirmed 2026-07-23)

Idle composer shape is the bordered `> ` glyph.
Against `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`: bordered `> ` is `empty`, bordered `> PENDING...` is `pending`, bare `>` is `unknown`.
No `FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE` override is required.

### Exit (2026-07-21)

`/exit` plus one Enter closes the pane.

### Resume (2026-07-21)

`kimi --yolo --model kimi-code/k3 --continue` restores the durable session for that cwd.

### Busy-pane signature (2026-07-23) - VERIFIED

While `agent_status=working` on a real K3 turn, the pane showed two ASCII-stable busy phases distinct from idle:

1. Reasoning: a braille spinner prefix plus the literal ASCII `thinking...` (example capture: `⠙ thinking...`).
2. Tool execution: the literal ASCII `Running a command` (example: `● Running a command` / `$ sleep 15; echo X`).

Idle footer remains `yolo  K3 thinking: max` (or `high`).
That idle string contains `thinking` but not `thinking...`, so the busy regex must match the ellipsis form only.

Wired into the shared `FM_BUSY_REGEX_DEFAULT` (overridable with `FM_BUSY_REGEX`) as:

```text
thinking\.\.\.|Running a command
```

Moon-phase emoji spinners (`🌕`/`🌔`/...) also appear mid-turn but are not used in the regex (not ASCII-stable).
`Press Ctrl+B to run in background` appeared during a long shell tool call and is tool-specific, not the general busy signature.

### Interrupt (2026-07-23) - VERIFIED

Keystroke: `Ctrl+C` (`pane send-keys ... C-c`).
Evidence: mid-turn pane printed `Interrupted by user`, `agent_status` returned to `idle`, and `pane process-info` still showed a live `kimi` / `kimi-code` process in the same pane.
Matches the primary interrupt fact; now verified on the worker path as well.

### Crewmate turn-end hook (2026-07-23) - VERIFIED

Mechanism: `[[hooks]]` `event = "Stop"` in `KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`.
Live marker log from an isolated worker home after a completed short turn:

```text
UserPromptSubmit 2026-07-23T21:58:44Z
Stop 2026-07-23T21:58:48Z
```

Stop stdin payload (verbatim):

```json
{"hook_event_name":"Stop","session_id":"session_d3399d49-b83b-4b0a-bf5f-fd90abe04be0","cwd":"/private/tmp/kimi-worker-cert-fezvWk","stop_hook_active":false}
```

An interrupted turn fired `Interrupt` instead of `Stop` (expected).
Project-local worktree config/plugin hooks did **not** fire (marker stayed empty when launched without the isolated `KIMI_CODE_HOME`).
Consequence for `fm-spawn`: install a per-task isolated `state/<id>.kimi-home` with auth symlinks from the source Kimi home and a Stop hook that `touch`es `state/<id>.turn-ended`.
Never edit the captain's `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` for worker turn-end.

### Process name / liveness (2026-07-23)

`pane process-info` reported `name: kimi` and `argv0: kimi-code`.
`bin/backends/tmux.sh` treats `*kimi*` as `alive`.

## Primary pointer

Primary-only certification and e2e evidence remain in `docs/architecture.md` (2026-07-19) plus `docs/turnend-guard.md`, `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`, `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md`, and `docs/cd-guard.md`.
Primary facts are unchanged by this worker certification.
