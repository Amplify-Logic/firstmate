# Starship bridge view

The captain's phone-first read-only fleet page.
`bin/fm-bridge-view.sh` and `bin/fm-bridge-view.py` own commands, bind, auth, and snapshot mechanics; read the script header before first use.

## What it is

A glance of what needs the captain, what is under way, what just finished, and what is waiting.
It is an observation of durable fleet records, not a place to approve, answer, merge, or spawn.
Tapping a GitHub pull-request link is the only outbound jump, and those URLs are allowlisted.

The page is served from the Mac on IPv4 loopback and published on the tailnet with **Tailscale Serve HTTPS**.
It never uses Tailscale Funnel and never binds `0.0.0.0`.

Bookmark: `https://<magicdns-name>/` after Serve is pointed at the loopback port.

## Auth

There is one captain, so there is no account system.
The first visit shows Log in.
A dedicated high-entropy passcode, not the glasses relay token, sets an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict, host-only session cookie with about a seven-day lifetime.
The salted scrypt hash lives at `bridge/passcode.hash` inside a mode-0700 `bridge/` directory.
Sessions live in `bridge/sessions.json`.
Logs go to `bridge/bridge.log`, not into `state/`.

`config/bridge-view` may contain `host=<magicdns-name>` for Host and login Origin checks.
`FM_BRIDGE_VIEW_HOST` overrides that file.

Initialize once:

```sh
FM_HOME=/path/to/home bin/fm-bridge-view.sh init-passcode
```

That writes the hash and a one-shot plaintext envelope at `data/bridge-view-passcode.txt` (mode 0600) so firstmate can hand the passcode to the captain.
Delete the envelope after it has been delivered.
Never put the passcode in a URL.

Lost phone: run `bin/fm-bridge-view.sh revoke-sessions`, and if needed remove the phone from the tailnet.

A VoiceLoop compromise can still read fleet files because both processes run as the same Mac user.
Separate passcodes only limit token leakage, not a full process break.

## Serving

Listen only on `127.0.0.1:8766` (override the port with `FM_BRIDGE_VIEW_PORT`).
Publish with Serve, never Funnel:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8766
```

`bin/fm-bridge-view.sh check-funnel` refuses if Funnel is on.
The server also refuses to start while Funnel is on.

Keep the process alive across reboot with launchd, same KeepAlive pattern as `com.firstmate.glasses-voice-mailbox`.
Render a local plist and install it by hand; this is a machine-local setup action, not tracked captain state:

```sh
FM_HOME=/path/to/home bin/fm-bridge-view.sh render-plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.firstmate.bridge-view.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.firstmate.bridge-view.plist
```

## Observation

The page calls `bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh --json --passive-view`.
That named Bearings mode is allowed while away mode is on; ordinary `/bearings` chat still refuses until return catch-up finishes.
The server caches one observation for about 30 seconds, runs one refresh at a time, and caps subprocess time and output size.
It never takes the session lock, never drains notifications, and never writes backlog or state.

The mailbox indicator is a local listen or launchd check.
It must never call `GET /v1/announcements`, because that call marks announcements delivered.

If refreshes stop, the already-open tab overlays "Cannot reach the desk" from the client clock.
Last-good on the server cannot save a tab that never hears back.

## Writes

Slice 1 is log-in POST plus GET.
There is no approve, answer, merge, or spawn control on this page.
