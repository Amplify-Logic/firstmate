# Starship bridge view

The captain's phone-first fleet page.
`bin/fm-bridge-view.sh` and `bin/fm-bridge-view.py` own commands, bind, auth, snapshot, and photo-drop mechanics; read the script header before first use.

## What it is

A glance of what needs the captain, what is under way, what just finished, and what is waiting.
It is an observation of durable fleet records, not a place to approve, answer, merge, or spawn.
Tapping a GitHub pull-request link is the only outbound jump, and those URLs are allowlisted.
The same authenticated page also accepts one-tap photo drops from the captain's phone.

The page is served from the Mac on IPv4 loopback and published on the tailnet with **Tailscale Serve HTTPS**.
It never uses Tailscale Funnel and never binds `0.0.0.0`.
The server requires Python 3.12 and uses only the standard library.

Bookmark: `https://larss-macbook-pro-2.taile26864.ts.net/` after Serve is pointed at the loopback port.

## Auth

There is one captain, so there is no account system.
The first visit shows Log in.
A dedicated high-entropy passcode, not the glasses relay token, sets an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict, host-only session cookie with about a seven-day lifetime.
The salted scrypt hash lives at `bridge/passcode.hash` inside a mode-0700 `bridge/` directory.
Sessions live in `bridge/sessions.json`.
Logs go to `bridge/bridge.log`, not into `state/`.

`config/bridge-view` may contain `host=<magicdns-name>` for Host and POST CSRF checks.
`FM_BRIDGE_VIEW_HOST` overrides that file.
Login and other POST writes require CSRF proof on top of Host.
When the browser sends `Origin`, it must match `https://<host>` (or that host on port 443) exactly.
iPhone Safari omits `Origin` on this same-origin form POST, or sends the literal string `null` as privacy masking.
Both are treated as absent and accepted only when `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `same-origin` or `none`, or when `Referer` is an `https` URL whose host matches the expected Serve name.
A present but wrong Origin is always rejected.
Error responses drain a bounded unread request body (or close the connection) so a keep-alive socket does not treat leftover POST bytes as the next request line.

Initialize once:

```sh
FM_HOME=/path/to/home bin/fm-bridge-view.sh init-passcode
```

That writes the hash and a one-shot plaintext envelope at `data/bridge-view-passcode.txt` (mode 0600) so firstmate can hand the passcode to the captain.
Delete the envelope after it has been delivered.
Never put the passcode in a URL.

Lost phone: run `FM_HOME=/path/to/home bin/fm-bridge-view.sh revoke-sessions`, and if needed remove the phone from the tailnet.

A VoiceLoop compromise can still read fleet files because both processes run as the same Mac user.
Separate passcodes only limit token leakage, not a full process break.

## Serving

Listen only on `127.0.0.1:8766` (override the port with `FM_BRIDGE_VIEW_PORT`).
Publish with Serve, never Funnel:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8766
```

`bin/fm-bridge-view.sh check-funnel` refuses if Funnel is on.
The server also refuses to start while Funnel is on.
A tailnet-only Serve HTTPS proxy is Funnel off and is the supported publish path.

Keep the process alive across reboot with launchd, same KeepAlive pattern as `com.firstmate.glasses-voice-mailbox`.
Render a local plist and install it by hand; this is a machine-local setup action, not tracked captain state:

```sh
FM_HOME=/path/to/home bin/fm-bridge-view.sh render-plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.firstmate.bridge-view.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.firstmate.bridge-view.plist
```

## Observation

The page calls `bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh --json --passive-view`.
That named Bearings mode is allowed while away mode is on; ordinary `/bearings` chat still refuses until return catch-up finishes.
The server caches one observation for about 30 seconds, runs one refresh at a time, and caps subprocess time and output size.
It never takes the session lock, never drains wakes, and never writes backlog or state.
Photo drops are the exception write path documented below; observation GETs still only read.

The client refreshes every 30 seconds and also refreshes on `pageshow` and when a hidden tab becomes visible.
The four buckets show at most 5 Needs you, 8 Under way, 6 Just finished, and 5 Waiting in the wings rows, with an honest `N more` count for omitted rows.

The mailbox indicator is a local listen or launchd check.
It must never call `GET /v1/announcements`, because that call marks announcements delivered.

If refreshes stop for 90 seconds, the already-open tab overlays "Cannot reach the desk" from the client clock.
Last-good on the server cannot save a tab that never hears back.

## Writes

Login and logout POSTs remain the authentication writes.
The only other write path is an authenticated photo drop.

`POST /upload` requires the same session cookie plus Host and CSRF checks as login.
The body may be `multipart/form-data` with a `photo` file field, or a raw image body whose `Content-Type` is one of `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, or `image/heif`.
The server accepts those declared types only after magic-byte sniffing (JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC/HEIF); a matching header is not enough.
The request is capped at 15 MB and returns 413 when larger or 415 when the type or magic bytes are not an allowed image.
The per-session rolling-hour limit counts authenticated, non-empty attempts within that cap, including attempts later rejected as unsupported, and returns 429 after 30 such attempts.

Files land under `data/bridge-inbox/` (created mode 0700) with a unique timestamped name such as `20260819T113530Z-<hex>.jpg` and a sibling `.json` sidecar recording `received_at`, `original_name`, `size`, and `content_type`.
Names never overwrite; the directory is quarantined storage only.
The server does not execute, decode, or otherwise parse image contents beyond the magic-byte sniff.
Nothing else in the bridge process writes outside `bridge/` and this inbox.

The glance page exposes a phone-first file input (`accept` images, `capture` allowed) and submit control, a success or failure message, and the count of photos received today (UTC date of `received_at`).
Existing `form-action 'self'` and `connect-src 'self'` CSP directives cover the form and `fetch`; scripts and styles stay nonce-based.

There is still no approve, answer, merge, or spawn control on this page.
